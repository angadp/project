'' zuko looked up , distressed, screwing up his paper and throwing it in the bin . what was he going to do , he had no eyes on azula and she was a real threat ,being a better fire bender and all . '' everything alright  zuko ?'' said a soft and familiar voice . ursa, his mother had walked in . '' oh , hi mom .'' he replied casually. ursa threw him a comforting look .''come on zuko , something is wrong, i know these things .''  she continued . zuko was left with no choice than to explain his confliction to his mother .  '' remember when azula went round kidnapping the capital's young ?'' asked zuko. looking at her with his golden eyes . '' of course , it was so worrying .'' instantly, they were both reminded of the immense fear they felt for kiyi , his younger sister. ''well, mom i am thinking of putting together an elite force of fire benders to protect us , but i do not know whether it is a good idea . '' ursa's face looked more relieved after zuko expressed himself . ''well , '' she said '' i think it is a great idea and if you disagree, i know you will come to the best conclusion . i know better than you that you have certanly got your uncles wits , he is the wisest person i know . relax zuko , good night . '' said his mother as she headed for bed . what on earth did she mean . why couldn't he make the descision. ''sleep well mom'' he said in a voice loud enough for her to hear him.  the following morning,  zuko arranged a council meeting the following week and invited his uncle . in the mean time, he needed to focus on the navy's much needed upgrades . he got his architechts working on a new destroyer he codenamed the dragon of the west class . he also put his scientist and researchers to the task of finding an alternative weapon to the coal powered catapaults that the navy currently used.  in need of fresh air , the fire lord went on a walk throught the city meeting its poeple , the very ones he vowed to protect.  the week went by very quickly as the meeting was in a matter of hours . the fire lord had overslept , just as he woke up and he felt an enormous lump on his chest '' zu zu !'' squealed a small voice , rubbing sleepdust out of his eyes , zuko looked up and found that kiyi was lying atop him . re-adjusting his posture , it was only a matter of seconds before he tightly squeezed his 5 year old sister and then started  tickling her .''stop it zu zu it tickles .'' she gigled ecstatically '' zu zu, are you having a meeting today ? can i come ?'' her green eyes widened giving an innocent look that you would need a stone heart to refuse . feeling guilty, zuko considerd it. '' uh , why do you want to come, it is very boring , i would hate for you to feel like you wasted your time . '' he replied , trying to stress his point in a way that was realistic to her . he thought of what to say next but his thinking was disturbed when noren entered the room . ''dadda ! '' squealed kiyi who bounded into her father's arms . ''sorry if she was any trouble zuko, '' he turned to kiyi '' we were looking for you all morning . ''  zuko looked calmly at noren, his greying tied back hair flowing in the breeze . '' don't worry , she was no trouble , infact i am quite glad she came . anyway did you sleep well nor..'' before he could finish , noren decided to interrupt zuko calmly   ''please , call me 'dad' if that is allright'' he said in a gentle voice . zuko gave him a look of confusion as if his father said just call me ozai . '' ok then *dad,* have a nice morning. '' after dressing into his robes and mounting his crown , zuko went down to the meeting . stood infront of the door was a squat man wearing the uniform of a high ranking general  with a grey beard and silver hair , holding a tray of jasmine tea . his face was so jolly he could have been anyone's uncle .  '' prince , i mean fire lord zuko ...'' as he said this the fire lord easily recognised his uncle and before iroh could finish his scentence , he found he was already hugging zuko . ''be carefull !'' he said leaning dow to balance his tea tray, '' that could have been 10 cups of jasmine straight out of omashu , the stuff is so expensive that it brings tears to my eyes ! '' iroh heated another cup of jasmine tea. ''oh, sorry uncle . i d-didn't mean to .'' stammered somewhat nervously  and had  just managed to structure a sentence. '' zuko , if i can forgive you for disposing of your grand father's white lotus tiles , then do you not think i can for the *possibilitie* of spilt tea . '' soon after , iroh burst out laughing and was followed by zuko.    after they both went in, the meeting commenced . '' good morning to you all and may i thank you for coming on such short notice .'' zuko said ''now , as many of you may know , i am planning on creating an elite force of fire benders but , such a force would need a approval . as the fire lord, i have learned from the mistake of not seeking proper advice and that , it is safe to say that such a thing is guarenteed here . so, onwards with it ,who is in favour of the new guard ?''  the vote was unanimous in favour of zuko's proposal . the fire lord continued and as he did so turned to a short figure clutching a book . '' earlier this month i put some of my researchers to work  on upgrading the navy so , chief architecht priam and the head of scientific research for the military general zihon , what have you found out ? '' the head of architecture , priam got up to speak, he was tall and skinny with short, black  hair and a greying beard . '' well fire lord , we have desighned the dragon of the west destroyer .'' glancing back , zuko noticed iroh's eyes widen as interest in the new ship sparked throughout the meeting's participants . '' you would really name that thing after me ?'' whispered iroh into zuko's ear .'' yeah i did , is that alright .'' zuko responded quietly . he was worried that his uncle disliked the use of his former title . ''it is fine , let us get on with the meeting .'' once the conversation had died down between the generals and govenors the designers continued '' so we have managed to make the new destroyer 60% faster than the empire class and twice as big .'' the presentation went on for several hours the ship was 300m at the longest point and 175m metres wide . it consisted of two large dragon shaped pontunes which had a cannon that took 11 benders to fire . the new ship had guns in which a bender could pressurise their fire to fit in the barrel for its prescision and added power and velocity, they had small ones and large ones that ressembles ww2 destroyers  . in between the two pontunes was a large ram which coud heat up a multiple pressure points so that he could ram ships or break ice if he needed to offer sokka , katara or hakoda protection.  it had been two days since the meeting , and the first stage of recruiting had just finished now it was fieldtrip time . using his personal vessel , zuko took the first 50 men out of the 100,000 who trialed  to the sun warriors . the journey was long and hard but they made it . along with the men, crew and guards  , zuko took his mother ,his uncle ,noren, kiyi and his father -ozai- in chains to teach him firebending's true meaning .  upon arrival , they docked the ship and headed for the sun warriors in an unarmed tundra tank but this one was larger than usual . it was an hour until they reached at which point kiyi squealed ''look dadda , mamma , the stairway that zuko told me , it's real ! '' she exclaimed  with an expresssion that was similar to a kitten in a room of dead. '' hello , fire lord '' said a bowing shaman . the village had grown , everyone was fire bending, it was a nice sight to see considering they went into hiding  . ''well , i have come to teach these men the true meaning of fire bending, if it is alright with you of course ?'' the chief started laughing , the party was confused . ''well it's great you came ,obviously do not tell anyone! ''he said examining one of the recruits, he continued ''so , come inside the hall , we have a gift for you .'' the chief went into the hall where zuko and aang had first preformed the dancing dragon and were they almost starved to death in what was a failed attempt to steal the sunstone. the chief tapped something and the goldden stone popped up, this time he thrusted his fist producing a large stream of fire wich destroyed some of the stone below. he then got the sunstone and handed it to zuko '' for me ?'' questioned the fire lord . ''yes, when you first touched the egg , we were worried you had damaged it , however , it imprinted on you and because of that with you lies the unborn dragon's loyalty '' the chief explained . he went on further by stating that female dragons are blue and the male ones are red . ''thank you i am honored , but didn't fire lord sozin make sure there were no dragon eggs  ?'' asked zuko after bowing to the chief . the egg was warm in his hands , it was like holding solid lava . upon feeling a tug upon hiis robes , kiyi asked if she could touch the egg. zuko bent down and she stroked it but whithdrew due to the heat.  ''now then , get into pairs and hold the fire , then you are to march up the mountain and dance for the masters . a roar of laughter surged from the men . ''do you really think that i would bring you this far just for a *joke ''* shouted zuko angrily , his men were silienced and they rushed up the mountain . ''zu zu , i'm a bender but i have no one to go with , will you come with me  ?'' kiyi looked up at her brother . zuko agreed and they went up together . the chief handed kiyi the fire and she and her brother set off into the mountains . they were upon the stairway and zuko placed the egg down and started the dancing dragon. this time fire flew from his fists and they were larger and more vibrant than usual . kiyi's bending was alot stronger , she would definately win if zuko were her age . they both gasped in amazement at the colourful fire . eventhough he had already witnessed and produced the flame , zuko was bewildered , it was like a caveman first sighting the burning orange energy that was fire . suddenly , the egg started to crack and a red dragon emerged , it was no smaller than kiyi and it flew , onto zuko's shoulder.   when they had returned to the exploration vehichle , the everyone gasped in amazement as zuko played with the dragon. ''i think i will call him druck .'' said zuko to everyone . they all smiled , still discombobulated about the dragon. the fire chief turned to zuko '' then druck will be the first dragon to be born in over 100 years .'' as he explained this , he patted zuko on the back .   it had been 6 months since the visit , kiyi had practised alot as was zuko . the fire guard had finished recruiting it's first 5 batalions , they were the best troops . it consisted of 10,000 men per battalion , so zuko had a force of 50,000 elite guards along with 5,000 on the new destroyer wich he had just launched . the other 2 he would launch in one month and the 10 he just ordered were mid way in construction . during the period of the 6 months , zuko had trained so hard that his fire streams were almost as big as they were during sozin's comet . he could also use a charged attack to generate a fire comet that was about the same size as the one he created with his uncle . now was the big moment . he had summoned both his father and his uncle but not his mother or kiyi ; he was worried that if he messed up they would be petrified . zuko cleared his chakras, it was something aang tought him to do when they were searching for ursa . upon doing this , he closed his eyes and proceeded to move his arms in stiff  circular motions . the blue , electicity appeared . zuko touched his finger tips together and pointed it into the sky . he was thrilled and terrified. he had generated lightning . soon after he could generate it like his father and uncle .   looking round the palaec the next day, zuko spotted mai , he walked over ...   &#x200b;  thank you for reading, please upvote . if you are interested , chapter 2 will be out on tuesday next week.", "NSFW": "False", "title": "after the shadows , chapter 1 : the last dragons [spoilers for smoke and shadows and the search]"}, {"text": "hey guys fellow tm here, i'm just wondering if target sells any tapered jeans. for those that might not know tapered just means that it's a bit narrower at the ankle than it is at the thigh. i was just wondering if we do sell them and if i could get the dcpi or a link that would be awesome. thanks guys.", "NSFW": "False", "title": "tapered jeans"}, {"text": "will there be a single banner for these characters? not sure if that's the right term but what i mean is for example just shinji out of the 3 with other units.", "NSFW": "False", "title": "eom shinji, aizen, shunsui"}, {"text": "101 days until?? that's exactly what i've decided to find out. follow the journey of a vocal artist here: [https://101daysuntil.wordpress.com/2018/11/28/day-005/](https://101daysuntil.wordpress.com/2018/11/28/day-005/)!  &#x200b;", "NSFW": "False", "title": "101 days until: day 005 - freestyle/improv"}, {"text": "[https://streamable.com/2gzky](https://streamable.com/2gzky)", "NSFW": "False", "title": "irelia penta to seal the game"}, {"text": "they're my favorite artists, and i was just wondering. if not, you should check them out.", "NSFW": "False", "title": "has any one heard of andy gullahorn, andrew peterson, or andrew osenga?"}, {"text": "&#x200b;  https://i.redd.it/adxqw34w95121.png", "NSFW": "False", "title": "sayonara wildstar, it was... a journey..."}, {"text": "it's the day we've all been waiting for. i may be a little early for some of you, but us aussies and kiwis are always keen to get the party started.   i'll be celebrating by knocking out all my work as quickly as possible (online, ecommerce). i'm in brisbane, qld, and the weather is hoooooot. so i'll have a few too many beers, annoy my girlfriend by telling her how amazing this community is, while she rolls her eyes at the thought of me latching on to the concept of us having an internationally recognised name day.   how do you plan to spend the best holiday in the year,fellow matts?  p.s i'll also pester my best friend/rival michael, because he hates the entire concept of this sub, our day, and our beautiful community.   rejoice - the day is ours!", "NSFW": "False", "title": "happy international matt day!"}, {"text": "please stay away from playing online with competitive settings.

specifically virtual slot machine used within games known as loot boxes.  slowly over recent years games have become more and more inundated with loot boxes that use the same tactics as slot machines in casinos to drip feed small meaningless rewards with low chance of obtaining something of value.   these loot boxes are prevalent in nearly all games from free to play mobile titles to multi million dollar titles.  these loot boxes are normalizing gambling for a generation of children and young people and most parents have little to know idea what is happening.  developers do not have to disclose the chance of receiving items from these loot boxes but in countries such as china where companies have been forced to disclose chances to win, it has been learned that some items have a less than 1 percent chance of being obtained.  loot boxes have ruined peoples lives and continue to do so as companies continue to prey on addicts (known as whales within the industry) who spend thousand upon thousands of dollars on loot boxes. countries such as belgium and japan have already moved to regulate loot boxes in come capacity but the united states is far behind.  recently us senator maggie hassan has asked the ftc to investigate loot boxes.  i ask that you please look into this matter and stand with senator hassan to make sure ftc stands by its commitment to investigating this epidemic.

weekend that darksiders 3 was coming out. :o! and so i got excited but at the same time i wondered, why i hadn't seen any marketing or anyone talking about this game till then. only reason i found out about it was cause of gamesradar (which is one of the few sites i still go to that isn't just about putting as many ad's in front of your face or giving you paid for reviews). though they kinda painted the game in a bit of a bad light complaining about the bugs etc.   &#x200b;  since then i was expecting some of the people i am subscribed to on youtube to do some review videos about it but still nothing even today. i actually had to go looking for reviews to see what other people said, and at least one or two painted the game a bit more positive though did mention the bugs/glitches being a problem.   &#x200b;  as for the marketing i only today saw a advertisement when i started up steam showing that darksiders 3 is released which is nice. i can kinda understand if the company that bought up the rights to the game can't really afford marketing all that much but really surprised i am not hearing more reviews or more people talking about it. even with some of the bugs you would think there would be some people talking about it. so i'm a bit disappointed that this game isn't getting much hype since its great we were able to get a third one and hopefully a fourth one after this one.   &#x200b;  and as for the glitches/bugs i am giving the company some slack since they bought up the rights from another company so kinda uncharted waters for them in a way. though i know they have some of the team that made the last ones working for them too.   usually most companies in the past whenever they would buy up a license or whatever they would divert completely from what it used to be like and/or just use it as a cash grab for future titles etc. so i am glad gunfire took a chance and is making this game.   so i am willing to give them a pass for now on glitches and bugs since they will probably have a patch soon. yeah it would have been great and better if the game had released without some of those bugs/glitches but a lot of games these days do that unfortunately. and maybe/hopefully for the next game they will have learned more from the experience and we wont go through this again. but only time will tell.   &#x200b;  but yeah, where are the reviews, and posts about this game? i am not seeing it and it's a bit of a shame.   &#x200b;  as for me i am still deciding if i want to get it for ps4 (whenever i get one of those) or get it for pc. even though i got the first two for ps3 in the past. also kinda annoyed i didn't find out till yesterday that someone reviewing the game a bit claimed if you had pre-ordered it you could have gotten the first two games remastered for free. if i would have known that i probably would have done that and gotten them all for pc. now if i want to do it, it would cost me about a $100 bucks when i already own the first two games (original) for ps3.   &#x200b;  i kinda want to wait till maybe steam sale or something to get all 3 games in a bundle for cheaper, but at the same time i want to support this company cause i am glad they came through and released a third game to this great story thats been developing. as well as hopefully release a fourth one that is even better maybe... and

them turning into a blubbering idiot. me turning into a cold hard bitch.   the unfortunate thing is that not being aware of this while applying gender stereotypes that i was taught and observed throughout my life, i labeled men and women.  men: physically strong, emotionally strong, protective and dependable,  women: over emotional, physically weak and emotionally unreliable.  i have done my fair share of inner work based on this realization that i'm sick of over emotional people, myself included. i just can't condone it. i have a full grasp the saying \"no wants to fuck the crying girl in the corner\" which is why i've been taking the steps needed to rectify that. i've come a long way and i've still got a ways to go... but holy fuck i feel so much better. there's a small piece of my puzzle coming together.  which leads me to my next piece of work. my cognitive dissonance that i've been experiencing based on my views and beliefs that i have of women, the ones that have come into my life have been over emotional.. i also realized because of this that even though i'm sexually attracted to woman i've never had a strong desire to be in a relationship with a woman. it's just never felt right or sat comfortably in my mind and i was unable to understand it until now.  although when i think about being with men or even the thought of being with two men, i feel even more comfortable, protected and it feels right.  i'm aware that this could change however, i still have much work to do and you stated months ago that you're running out of time. so i'm aware that your patience and willingness to invest further is limited. that i'm completely fine with. i understand wholy. i want you to be happy and i want to be happy too you know.. i don't fear losing you anymore. i've done the necessary inner work to see what my life would be like without you and it doesn't scare me, it doesn't make me sad. in fact, what makes me most sad is knowing that we're both miserable trying to make this work.   don't get me wrong, i love you or at least i adore you and i care deeply about your happiness is how i translate love and i want to be with you, i could see us building a future together, but in my thoughts when i think about it, it's you and me against the world, that's what i see, so while it's nice to talk about what we'd like to do in the future and the life we want to build at the same time i stop and question it because ultimately, i believe we're seeing two totally different views. i don't feel the need for another person. one is enough for me.   i believe you came into my life at a crucial time and for a specific reason, and you have helped me progress in so many ways. i'm so much stronger, i mean i did a lot of self work, but without your insight and persistence i wouldn't have gotten this far so quickly.   i don't know what my future holds, that i'm still pondering, but i can promise you it's bright. regardless if we can find a way to make this work or we part ways. i know now that i am going to be fine. so for that i will forever be grateful to you.    this was a huge realization shortly after coming out of a depressive episode and initially i felt better after this, now i'm just not so sure. i read this after some time and i still see myself as extremely broken. i  appreciate being self aware, but to what extent if you're brokenness has been engrained since childhood. i guess i feel a little lost still.", "NSFW": "False", "title": "profoundly broken? i don't know anymore."}, {"text": "i wanted to make pecan tassies/tarts for christmas presents, but then i remembered how long it takes to shape the tart shell in my mini muffin pans.   i was wondering if anyone had experience with freezing mini tart shells that have not been baked yet? i want to freeze them after shaping the dough into shells and bake them with the filling at a later time.   also, does anyone have advice for thawing/baking after freezing? thanks!!!", "NSFW": "False", "title": "can i freeze unbaked mini tart shells?"}, {"text": "iso ga and d keys. leave price plz", "NSFW": "False", "title": "iso ga and d keys"}, {"text": "i'm just a normal guy and what normal guy wouldn't want to watch you with your partner or friend?", "NSFW": "True", "title": "35 (m4ff) #connecticut i want to watch"}, {"text": "so.. with the removal of the blizzcon championship.. did they do away completely with the yearly event?  is it purely the seasons now?

else's blips either.   different colored blips means low/netural/high honor, so good guys know who they're coming across.   this way, high honor players can easily find each other while avoiding

he tells me he misses me, enjoys being with me, and can't wait to see me. this starts fights over the summer as my anxiety goes off the wall and i fall into a deep depression, he said we were never on a break, just sleeping together. i show him screenshots of texts he sent and says that they're wrong. one literally said \"its a break, its not over\", but apparently i read it wrong. he said we are still exclusively hooking up.   by august, we are not even talking. he can't talk to somebody who accuses him of lies. we come back to school, and after a week of not seeing each other, he has his arm around me in public, is kissing me in public, and telling everybody how wonderful i am. i ask \"what are we?\" and he says we will talk later. i ask later, and he told me talking makes him uncomfortable. i still am head over heels, absolutely in love with him, even though he will completely forget i exist until sex is involved.   we still are exclusive come september, but he meets a girl through a friend. this friend likes this girl, and he tells me not to worry about her because shes boring. little did i know, he was actually sneaking off to see her right after he would sleep with me. to make it even worse, back home (we go to school 350 miles from home, 250 for him) she lives 10 minutes from me. somehow, he found a girl that i see around my hometown often. he knew i didn't want to hear about her, but he talked about how amazing she was a lot. i'd make a jab at her (which is of course out of spite and i'll admit was wrong) and he'd accuse me of being a bitch and tell me to stop making fun of her because we are exclusive. people still think we're dating and obviously she knows to stay away. he also blocked me on social media for talking to another guy and tells me i used him. we made up after discussing that we are exclusively hooking up and together and i told him i wasn't using this guy, who i ended up ghosting. i missed out on my opportunity to see somebody who was nice. he unblocked me.   flash forward to a month ago, after he told everybody at a halloween party how amazing i am and how much he likes me, he ditches me at this party to go hook up with her. i yell at him on the phone because i'm now having to walk back home, at 2am, from somewhere i don't know, intoxicated. he told me we were never exclusive, i pull out screenshots, and he tells me hes done.   i continue to call him out the next day, showing screenshots where he said we are exclusive but he can't handle the commitment to a relationship because of school, but tells me i'm a nasty person and blocks me on all social media.   two weeks later, i am talking to a new guy, just as a friend, and bring him over to a pregame at my friend's apartment. my ex was supposed to come, but because i asked if he was seeing this new girl, just out of curiosity, he told her i was talking badly about her, making fun of her underbite (which he does often), and she ended up crying and walking back to his apartment after staring at me and this guy. i called him out via text for lying and demanded he speak to me, he blocked me. he also has an external hard drive of mine and refuses to give it back.   now we are blocked on everything. however, my friend group is now split. this girl fears me because my ex told her i would assault her if i saw her (we live in the same dorm hall) and that i am bipolar. in a week or two, my friends plan on sitting us down to hash it out so we can at least be civil in the same room.   i never noticed until now, he would always belittle me in conversations, tell me i'm wrong, or butt into conversations i was having with other people and take over. he would belittle my hopes and dreams, telling me they were unattainable, and tell me i'm weird for not wanting children and not wanting to take my husband's last name. for him, i changed my life goals, something i never imagined i would do. but for some reason, i absolutely loved him. he gaslit me, he insulted me, refused to communicate, and lied. he was possessive, controlling, and manipulated me to always be hanging on to him so he could use me for sex when it was convenient. how could one say people are exclusive, yet sneak off to hang with another person? i understand we were not dating, but we still had a sexual relationship with the exclusivity that was broken and he used my love for him and mental state to manipulate me.  i now hear he also is controlling this new girl, drinking until hes obliterated every night with her, and not doing his schoolwork. he was always struggling with schoolwork, and because we are in the same major and always ahead on my work and understood it, he would always ask me to help him, which meant i would do it for him. now, he doesn't have that. he would also always use me for my car, but belittle me for owning an older car (we're 19, of course, i drive a piece of crap towncar, its reliable and i bought it myself and insured it myself).   but after now talking to this new guy, i really like him and he really likes me. we both were emotionally abused, he was cheated on multiple times, and want to take it slow. he cares about me, doesn't belittle me, he actually compliments me and shows affection, and he communicates how he feels. i no longer am anxious and depressed, i wake up feeling energized and ready for my day. i wake up, excited to do my schoolwork and go to work. i'm writing this after having a productive day, about to go to class actually, and i feel at peace now. i find myself not feeling overwhelming emotions, but rather as if everything will fall into place. i'm about to be in-between jobs due to on-campus positions only lasting a semester and going home, so i'm a bit tight money wise, which usually sends me over the edge, but i feel calm and collected as i navigate prepping for finals, applying for jobs, paying bills, and finishing final projects. i hope we end up dating, but i don't think i'll be ready for that until after winter break. i don't want to rush anything, but i really like him. he has similar life goals to my original plan, and we both want each other to go far and respect that we have to do schoolwork, and actually teach each other when helping one another (also in the same major!). i am learning to trust him, i find him more trustworthy around other women and he respects how i feel as well. he listens to what i have to say and wants to find solutions to any issue.   i finally am finding my inner peace after wasting a year of my life.   &#x200b;", "NSFW": "False", "title": "one month after ending emotionally abusive and toxic on-off like relationship"}, {"text": "bless you both and to mr. slave i hope you were fed well yesterday after selling to me quality buff out at a reasonable price.", "NSFW": "False", "title": "to the slave and his owner selling drugs"}, {"text": "im going to keep it simple:  1) empire and cis skins, boba fett too  2) fully functioning shoulder charge for han. it doesn't always register damage given and also fails to cancel properly.

 what do you think? why does she have to remind herself she is a princess?  was she bought by varys and illyrio just for viserys to obtain an army? if jon is ice and dany is not fire, who is? my next post will reveal my theory.", "NSFW": "False", "title": "fake dany (spoilers extended )"}, {"text": "cumslut college boi looking to have some fun in ks. love sucking cocks but would be open to more if it comes up. dm me and we'll see where things go.", "NSFW": "True", "title": "22 [m4m] kansas - fwb?"}, {"text": "new lord rush video just dropped, and we finally have an actual studio to crack those packs!! it has been a lot of hard work but we're finally seeing everything come to life. drop a like, subscribe and tell all your friends about this video!   thanks for the support everyone, without you the audience there is no lord rush!  https://youtu.be/lhqaaxymzss", "NSFW": "False", "title": "new youtube video!"}, {"text": "i am selling an old car and was wondering all the files i needed to sell it to someone else. do both parties have to go to a tax collectors office to complete the dmv title transfer?

(btw, this specific pair of underwear was just a fairly basic black and gray pair from victoria's secret. i wouldn't call it a thong but it was small enough in the back that the majority of both my gf's and this stripper's asses showed with it on).  i paid for one more dance (so much for easing my guilt) and went on my way. i needed to rub one out as soon as i got back to the hotel.  while i told my girlfriend about the strip club and the lap dance (she actually didn't care, hooray!) i did not mention the underwear. of course, every time i saw her in it my mind raced back to that night in vegas.  fast forward, and every year for our super bowl trip we go back to the same spot. i have not had the good fortune of finding another dancer wearing something familiar, but each year when i get back i search to find the same (or as close as possible) to the same pair that i received a lap dance in to buy for my girlfriend (then fiancee, and now wife). every year, the first time she wears it i make sure i fuck her from behind and pull it to the side, letting my mind wander back to whoever i spent 5 minutes with at crazy horse. it is honestly the only time i ever fantasize about someone else in bed.  bonus: this year's edition was something similar to this (but not this one exactly):

i feel selfish and fickle, while he's faithful and stable. (never cheated or met someone who's made me consider it, btw... but polyamory does spark my interests!)  &#x200b;  so... i'm a 21yr old female, dating a 27yr old man (been together for 3 years now), we rarely fight, broken up once, and overall have a \"great\" relationship. we share the same humor, values, and interests. he brings a lot to the table that has nothing to do with his career or money, which i love most about him. but this past year i've been feeling like i'm \"settling\". he's pretty much the only serious relationship and greatest love of my life, which isn't saying much since my past relationships were in high school. we met at the end up my senior year (18yr) and started dating after i graduated. now, as he approaches his 30s, and i'll be graduating college soon, i know he'll be ready for the \"next step\" - living together, marriage, kids and all that. i feel like because he has 6 years on me, he's experienced more in life, with sex, love, relationships, etc. part of me wants to be single and seek such things out, yet i don't want to lose him. i also don't know if i'll ever find someone who tickles my fancy in all the ways he does. i'm attracted to him, the sex is great, we have lots of fun, and the few things i don't like about him he is actively working on. yet, i feel like i love him rather than i'm in love with him sometimes. or maybe i don't love him as much as he loves me? is it cruel to stay with someone when i feel this way? sometimes i want to just move away to a new city and live, but i have a feeling i may be disappointed with the outcome.  &#x200b;  growing up reading romance novels and watching movies has given me a totally distorted idea about love in the real world. do you guys feel disillusioned by the media too? i don't have an overpowering response to him, or think about him all day long, or wish to be with him every moment of the day. but i feel totally content with that. when we first met i did feel those things, but over time those feelings faded as we became more comfortable with each other. the butterflies have disappeared. but isn't that normal? or is that what ruins marriages? some say you should never settle for a love that doesn't burn, yet i question if such a love really exists? and if it does, aren't those usually the types that never work out? bittersweet? is it better to find someone you love in such a way and can see them as a life partner? a good parent? someone, to grow old with? someone who is willing to work on the bad things? is that the kind of person we \"settle\" for and marry? or do we end up divorcing that person and finding someone else who sparks our fire?  &#x200b;  i can't imagine opening up and getting to know another in the way we have together, or even having sex with someone else. i consider him my best friend above all else. but, i still wonder what potentially meeting someone else could be like, yet it's hard to imagine at the same time. fyi, i've never cheated. then, with the dating scene so dependent on apps and social media, meeting someone and falling in love as organically as my current bf and i did sounds impossible, lol.  &#x200b;  are these feelings

always have a place in my heart, yet i find myself content just doing my own thing for most of the time. i see a future with him, but i also wonder if i'm robbing myself of some potentially exciting life in my twenties. i feel like he is stable and consistent, while i'm fickle and selfish. is this an age thing or permanent character traits? he's mentioned letting me go off and doing my own thing since i'm much younger and \"inexperienced\" than him when we discuss this stuff. i never feel like he's holding me back. i know he would support me if i took a job in a new city or state and wanted to go on without him. i might even like having a long distance relationship with him, is that crazy?  &#x200b;  i'm sorry, i don't even know where i'm going with this. i guess i would like to know if

more seizures. i have epilepsy, and i thought, everyone thought, i was doing really well with not having them. but then, they started becoming more constant. first, it was once a year, then every 9 months, then every 6 months but only ever at home. but unfortunately, a few weeks ago i had one at work. fortunately, someone caught me before i hit my head on the hard tile floor. my doctor and co-workers and bosses said i shouldn't feel bad at all for what happened, but i did, i still do. not only for that time, but last sunday i had another seizure at work. i hit my head this time. i missed almost a week of work because of that. my boss and doctor and family think it's due to 'stress', mainly because i work 6 days a week for 8 plus hours and do other people's jobs but i really don't mind it. i'd rather be at work than at home. i don't like just sitting around. yes i do go to the gym or to the mall, but i don't like to go to bars/clubs or staying out late. doing those things gives me so much anxiety yet i need to be moving around, socializing with people but people i know. i work at a senior 'independent' living home, so i know everyone. anyways, i'm so worried that i'll get my days/hours cut because this has already happened 3 times. when i first started there (i've been there 2 and a half years) i had one before dinner service started, it freaked everyone out but then i didn't have anymore there, just at home and my hours didn't change much till people started quitting and i got better hours. now that i've had 2 at work, and they were literally about a month apart i'm so worried about those hours. i know i \"shouldn't feel bad\" but i do. i'm not only embarrassed for myself but embarrassed for the company, my boss, my co-workers. i know it's \"illegal\" to fire or give less hours/days because of what happened but i feel like if they could, they would. i know they hired me knowing of my condition but they also knew if they didn't, they could get in trouble. \"don't feel bad, you couldn't control it.\" my boss said. i know, but i still feel bad. i absolutely hate sitting at home. the co-worker i'm close to facetimed me today, all the cooks and other co-workers asked how i was doing and we all joked around. it made me feel good, important even and i miss them all. they can't wait for me to come back and i can't wait either. i know they want me there, i wanna be there. i hate being in a small, secluded area most of the time (home). it's just me, my mum, her husband and my younger sister, when i'm home. i know this post doesn't have to do a whole lot about my hours but it's scaring me most. see, a bunch of people call out. we don't have a lot of employees and we get at least 1 call out a day which stresses the bosses out (understandable) but they won't fire the person because we're 'desperate', so they call me, if i'm off. i know i can say no, but like i said, i'd rather be there than home so in general this stress is my fault so these seizures are probably my fault as well even tho i take my medications on time and such. i, like most, have bills/rent and other things to pay, so i know a lot worry about their hours too but this reason is bothering me so much. so much so that i want to pull my hair out, it's hard to sleep at night, i keep cracking my fingers and wrists. i know others have it way worse, i hate

{"text": "#**how do i count elixir?**  okay, elixir, one of the two things that your opponent knows about and you don't. however, working it out has always been a secret skill in clash royale that not many people talk too in depth about. i made a [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3nwy3xchd4) on this recently, and it shows everything in this post but with visual examples. today, however, i hope to go pretty deep into your favourite royale technique and uncover the mysteries of your opponent's elixir bar. so, counting elixir was a concept founded in competitive games as players wanted to get an edge onto their opponent. for those playing strategy games before clash royale, it was obvious that extracting information from your opponent was going to edge you an advantage. we'll get more into that later, but i know you're all here to discover how on earth you're supposed to know a number that is both hidden from you and constantly changing. i'm no expert, but with the right techniques anyone can be. so, to count elixir it is best done through counting the deficits in every trade. for every card you play, minus its elixir cost in your head. for every card your opponent plays, add its elixir cost on. every game will start at 0, but here's an example so that makes sense. if your opponent cycles an electro wizard, you're now at plus 4 elixir. if you now cycle archers, you have to minus 3 elixir from your 4 advantage. 4 minus 3 is 1, meaning you now have a 1 elixir lead. this is extremely simple, right? you just need to keep your base value in mind and minus your own troops, whilst plusing your opponent's. because you are now ahead by 1 elixir, this means that you will reach 10 elixir first. this is important, but essentially what it means now is that you will play first. if you decide to invest a knight in the back, then you take your 1 elixir advantage and minus 3. you know you're down 2 elixir, however you have a knight on the board. troops on the board are underrated when it comes to spending elixir - this knight essentially only cost you 2 elixir because of the trade you made earlier on in the game. that's the key factor to counting elixir. some cards are way more potent when you get them for under their cost. a knight, for example, can easily be shut down by something cheap like bats. this negates your 1 elixir deficit. however, if you instead spent a royal ghost here, then your opponent can't make a positive 1 elixir trade on it without taking damage. let's recap. you've overall spend archers and a royal ghost, and your opponent has spent and electro wizard and bats. both of these combos cost 6 elixir, however you will get royal ghost damage onto the tower. from this one small trade at the start of the game, you've manufactured royal ghost hits onto the tower and subsequently a damage lead. that's just a tiny example of a one elixir gain, so imagine this in the hands of a pro player when they've generated massive gains of 4 or 5 elixir. one elixir in this game is so undervalued, so it's very important to always keep your elixir managed and have in mind what your opponent is on so you're ready to defend. sometimes, counting elixir can prove both tedious and difficult - especially when a lot is going on in a match. luckily, there is a valuable portion of the game that can help you regain an idea of how much elixir your opponent is sat on. usually, after both players have committed to an attack, there's a re-gen period where you both sit and wait for 10 elixir. the player who plays first is up in elixir, because they reach 10 before their opponent. if you reach 10, then play a 5 elixir giant, you can count on your bar how much your opponent is down by. if you spend the 5, then when you hit 8 again your opponent spends, you can almost tell that they needed 3 more elixir to reach 10 again. this means that you were 3 elixir ahead, and it's a good idea to push right now to make use of that advantage that you have. if you haven't reached 10 yet, but your opponent has played a card, look to see how much elixir you need to reach 10 to tell how much you're down by. if they play and you're at 8, then you're down 2 elixir as they have just played at 10. this method of 'counting' doesn't require any actual maths, but only happens a few times every game. it's less accurate, but way easier to do. ideally, you will be able to do both during the same game and know the exact amount of elixir that your opponent is on. there are some niche examples where you can struggle, for example against an elixir collector, however the second technique will be more helpful here as you'll want to count in the reset period. it's almost impossible to count all of the trades and add in when the collector is collecting.  ----------------------------------------  #**what can i do when i know my elixir advantage/deficit?**  clash royale flows very well as a game. once you reach 10 elixir, you're looking to play cards as to not waste any elixir that you're generating (as we just discussed). this works out very well. when you're ahead, you will play the first card as to not waste elixir. when you're ahead, you wish to attack now as to hopefully take advantage of your opponent's lesser elixir count. when you're behind, you wish to defend now as to make use of defender's advantage. here's a clip from a previous video so i don't have to go over that again. let's focus on that defending thing first. we spend elixir, to produce cards, to generate damage. so, we always spend elixir to produce damage right? well, our crown tower gives us free damage, so it is technically worth elixir. if you can defend a 4 elixir unit with just 2 elixir and your crown tower's damage, then you've gained 2 elixir by simply defending. this is the natural flow of clash royale that i mentioned. if you're up in elixir, you want to push and make advantage of that elixir. if you're down in elixir, you want to defend and try to regain that elixir by using defender's advantage. basically, if you're low on elixir when your opponent invests, then it is probably a good idea to sit back and regain your elixir. if you're high on elixir though, you will want to punish - although that's something for later on in this video.  ----------------------------------------  #**what about units that don't die? how do i account for those?**  counter attacking units are a menace for explaining this strategy. their existence on the board adds a lot of complications to my explanations, but i'll go through how they should affect your play when you know your opponent's elixir. so, after you defend you will most likely be up on elixir due to the theory we just explained about the crown tower. for this example, we will assume that both players start on even elixir. if you have a musketeer that just defended an electro dragon, then you know you're up one elixir, but you also have a musketeer on the board. this musketeer isn't worth 4 elixir because it has been damaged, so we'll say that it represents about 2 elixir. right now, in this example, you have a physical 1 elixir lead, and a 2 elixir musketeer attacking. this means that you're technically up 3 elixir in this moment, and when you're up on elixir you want to be attacking. putting a hog rider in front of this takes 4 elixir away from you, meaning you're down one elixir. you now have a hog rider and a half health musketeer attacking, whilst your opponent only has one elixir to defend. well, good luck to them because to me that looks like a ton of damage. all you did here was leverage a one elixir lead and turn it into damage, imagine if this was again a 4 or 5 elixir lead. of course, in a real game, your opponent wouldn't just spend the 1 elixir, but they'd be forced to spend maybe 4 to 5 elixir and take some damage. this means that you're up 3 to 4 elixir and got damage. either way it's a good trade, and all you did was take advantage of a counter attacking unit. however, it's not always smart to push in with a counter attacking unit. say that you used that musketeer to defend some spear goblins. that damaged musket puts you down 2 elixir. if you spend a hog rider in front, you're now down 6 elixir. if your opponent spends a mega knight to clear all of this up, you now have the same one elixir to defend an entire mega knight. this goes back to the 'imagine if it was a 4 or 5 elixir lead' thing, because your opponent had a 6 elixir lead and spent it well. this is called over-committing, and is something that you can work out when you should do if you know your opponent's elixir. if you're ahead, go hard with these units. if you're behind, stay home and continue to regain your elixir. it's all very simple once you get that initial technique down.   ----------------------------------------  #**how can this knowledge affect my general gameplay?**  knowing your opponent's elixir can lead to a lot more, however. you can use it for a ton of things to work around your offensive game-plan. if you're up a hefty amount of elixir, you know that your opponent doesn't want to punish your investment. so, you can happily invest and make use of your elixir advantage. however, if your opponent is up on elixir and you're an investment deck, you can happily wait until they play their punish into you. defending this will give you an elixir lead, and then you can obviously invest with both an elixir lead, and with their punish card out of rotation. with a punish deck, you know to not push in when your opponent is up on elixir. this can cause your opponent to take advantage of those counter attacking units as we discussed before - and you could get totally screwed here. however, if you're up on elixir with a fast attacking punish deck, then you can happily go in. here's a tip for that. if you're up 3 elixir with a hog rider deck, as soon as you get to 4, spend that hog rider. knowing your opponent is only on 1 elixir, they may have little to no counter to your push. however, if you're up that same 3 elixir and wait until 10, you will spend that hog when they're at 7 and may get countered by a mega knight or something very successfully. knowing your opponent's elixir not only tells you if you should push, it can also tell you at how much elixir you should push. let's reverse this situation. if you know that you're down 3 elixir against a hog deck, you will know when they can afford that hog. knowing when they're about to push will allow you to be ready with your defensive units almost as a prediction. skeletons planted extremely early will make a hog get less hits than if they're late because you weren't expecting an attack. this goes for all win conditions, and counting elixir is extremely powerful.   ----------------------------------------  #**how am i able to be up in elixir?**  we've discussed a little bit about generating leads, but we should go in more. a lot of decks will run cards that allow the user to gain elixir leads and take advantage of their opponent. 2.6 is a great example. defending a mini pekka or something with an ice golem gets you an easy plus 2 elixir trade. this then allows you to push in at 4 elixir, knowing your opponent only has 2 to defend with. it's very obvious how you generate a good trade, right? you just spend less than your opponent did and boom you're up on elixir. continue to do this, with the combination of knowing the exact count of elixir in your opponent's bar, and then you're in for a good time. poor trades can lead to your opponent having this advantage, so it's important to always weigh up how much you're spending when defending (up and coming soundcloud rapper, me).  ----------------------------------------  #**okay, i have an elixir lead, what now?**  let's talk about potentially compounding your elixir lead when you know that you have one. there's an important concept to understand before we go into this, and that's called using your tower as a resource. so, if your opponent is down on elixir and decides to let a mega minion hit their tower, they may be taking that 500 or so damage in order to regain 3 elixir. once you're in a position as to where your opponent wants to regain elixir, you can force them into difficult decisions by throwing cards that will gain you damage if they leave. some of the best ones are quick and high damage cards like hog rider. it's unlikely, but if your opponent leaves a hog then that's so much damage that you get and only lose out of 4 elixir. this is a really efficient card for compounding your lead. investment buildings are also good, as it makes your opponent want to spend. a barbarian hut alone will get a load of damage, but your opponent may not have the elixir or willpower to spend on countering it. it compounds your lead slowly but surely, as long as you don't make terrible trades during its lifespan. high value chip cards are amazing too, as it's a tough decision for your opponent. should they just leave that dart goblin and regain their elixir? newer players may mess up on this quick decision, which either allows you a ton of damage or the potential to retain your elixir lead. any card that really makes your opponent want to spend more is good for compounding. either you will gain damage and lose your lead, or you will potentially just retain or improve upon your lead. a great example is high spell bait-y cards. if your opponent is down on elixir, they may still think it's a good trade to fireball archers. sure, they gained 201 damage, however they made their elixir deficit even worse. if you can now capitalise on that extra lead, you will most likely come out with more than 201 damage assuming you know what you're doing.   ----------------------------------------  #**do i always have to attack when up in elixir?**  not necessarily, but you should always be trying to convert that extra elixir into damage. taking x amount of tower health from your opponent's tower for y amount of elixir is undefined as far as how efficient it should be. the fireball on archers example from earlier is good, because you spend 1 elixir to get 201 damage, however if you're down on elixir then your opponent will most likely punish this and gain way more value than you just did. you have to know whether you're up or down on elixir before committing to something like this. if you're up elixir, then take trades like a lightning onto a musketeer. you spent 2 elixir, but got 300 damage which isn't bad. however, if you're down on elixir, you might only want to take trades like a lightning onto a wizard. you spent one, which can be dangerous, however 300 damage for 1 elixir is maybe too good of a trade to pass up. we've covered how much of a difference one elixir can make, but again there's no defined damage per elixir cost that we can follow. personally, i would say that 200 damage for 1 elixir spent would be a good average to go off. sometimes, you will just have to weigh up if your opponent can punish your 1 elixir spent on that lightning and get over 200 damage for it.   ----------------------------------------  #**conclusion: will this automatically make me a pro player?**  everything in clash royale is situational, but i hope today i've taught you the theory behind elixir counting/management and how to apply it yourself. this is a skill that takes a lot of practice, and that's why only a short segment of [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3nwy3xchd4) (and this post) was actually on how to count the elixir itself. it comes with time, so every game you play you should attempt to know the exact amount in your opponent's hand. sometimes, playing a classic challenge or on a new account can help. facing the easier opponents means that more of your brain power can go into counting elixir than actually having to outplay your opponent. once you're a pro with counting elixir, then boom take it into a gc or high ladder and see how many people you can outplay. your general feeling for being up or down in elixir will come over time, especially in double elixir time when it's way too hectic to always count. it won't guarantee you becoming the best player in the game, however it is probably the best skill-set to have in my opinion. so yeah, that's all for elixir counting and management. i hope you enjoyed the post, and thanks for reading :)", "NSFW": "False", "title": "how important is

took a while, but i'm back again with the third entry of  this small series. work and laundry and dishes take time, time that could be used to read, but alas, it must be done.  this novel is also a bit different from the others, seeing as it's not actually one long coherent story, but rather a collection of shorter stories. it's also a bit strange in the sense that the last of the three stories wasn't actually adapted to the anime in season 1, but opted to adapt it as the first episode of the second season instead, for reasons i don't know.  but with that out of the way, on to the actual post:      volume|arc|page count|adapted episodes :--|:--|:--|:--| 5|three stories|224|s01 e18-e20 + s02e01  # reading the book  reading the book itself took three days from monday to today.  the prologue as well as the first two chapters were done on monday, the third chapter on tuesday, and the fourth chapter and the epilogue today. as i was going through it, i took note that the book's 4 chapters were more or less separated up into the exact episodes that cover the novel. i thought this was kind of neat. the reason this arc is called the \"three stories\" arc is because it's not one big story, but more three smaller stories that just so happen to all occur on the same date: the 31st of august, the last day of the summer holiday. the three stories in question are the touma/mikoto pretend-date, accelerator's run-in with last order, and finally touma and index's fight against a magician who is looking for one of the grimoires in index's head.  considering this novel contains one of my favorite episodes from the first season of the anime (as i've stated elsewhere in this sub), that being the touma/mikoto pretend-date, i was of course very excited to read this novel, and that's probably also why i bulldozed my way through half of the book on the first day, seeing as that particular story was covered in chapter 2. the rest of the novel, or rather, chapter 3, the second half of accelerator's story, caught me by surprise and it was a pleasant surprise. the final chapter however, eh, i didn't much care for it in the anime, and reading it didn't really redeem it for me.   # comparing it to the anime  the first season of the anime covers the first two stories, accelerator and touma/mikoto, leaving the third story out completely, only for it to be adapted as the first episode of the second season. so during my rewatch, i had to cheat a little in viewing order to get it all right. but from what i can tell, the four episodes covering this novel do a great job of adapting the novel, mainly because each episode corresponded to one chapter in the book. the accelerator story was told in two of the four chapters, after all (chapter 1 and 3, as well as the epilogue), so it made sense to make it the only two-parter in the anime.  one thing that is a really big plus for the novel is, of course, the inner monologues of the characters, and letting the reader learn of the motivations of the people we follow in the story, and in this novel we really get into the mind of accelerator and learn about his motivations and why he wants to help and protect last order. this isn't that well explained in the anime, as we don't get to hear his thoughts, other than a flashback in the beginning of the second episode, and it does make it a bit confusing for an anime-only watcher. you *could* deduct from his actions and last order's long spiel in the diner about accelerator's behavior during the experiment, that deep down he's not such a bad guy, and wants some redemption, but his reason to protect last order in particular doesn't come across in the anime at all. basically, he wants to protect her in particular because she didn't see him as a target to beat, or a monster to be feared; she saw him as a person, and a friend. something he came to realize he wanted, deep down.   and that's the pleasant surprise i mentioned earlier. and it's something you lose completely if you only watch the anime.  the story of touma and mikoto's pretend-date was also more or less covered in full, although with a few unnecessary scenes removed (like the actual purchase and payment of the hot dogs) and a few details altered (tsuchimikado, aogami and touma turning a corner just walking and talking instead of being in an all-out brawl with each other). other than that, everything was pretty much the same, even fake-unabara's answers on touma's quiz, and mikoto saving touma from a falling girder with magnetism. heck, in neither the novel nor the anime do we actually get to hear the answer touma gives fake-unabara when he asks touma to protect mikoto. it was that faithfully adapted, which was honestly surprising to me.  the last story, with the magician and his magic bracer-bow contraption was also decently adapted. there were hardly any discrepancies between the novel and the episode, so that's always a positive, but as i said earlier, this is a story i didn't really care for, mostly because it feels like a \"filler\" episode, and so does the story in the novel. it felt like padding that doesn't add to the overall story, because as far as i can tell, based purely on what we've seen in the anime so far (the title of this series of mine is \"my journey through the novels *as an anime-only fan*\" after all), the magician never shows up again, meaning his story is done and he won't influence the story beyond this one chapter. and while both novel and anime are more or less the same, it cannot shake this feeling i have about it.   # overall impression of the story  reading the novel has most certainly made my experience with the three stories arc better, if only for the fact that it allowed me to understand the thought process and reasoning of accelerator's actions during his story. if there's one thing to take away from this, it should be that chapter 1, 3, and the epilogue of this novel give you a far better understanding of accelerator than the anime adaptation did, even though the anime adaptation *did* stay relatively faithful to the source material. but the simple fact that it didn't include most of accelerator's thoughts hurts the story overall. the other two stories are, however, so well adapted in their episodes that you don't lose anything important if you skipped the 2nd and 4th chapter of the novel.

advice, please hear me out and i apologise if i rambled a lot...   i'm 18yrs old, asian girl and started university for about 4 months now... a little of a back story, as you all know asians are usually smartass people but unfortunately, i am definitely not one of them. ever since highschool, i've been struggling to put my grades up from the beginning to end, yet i almost failed but managed to make it. now that i got admitted to a university (which is awesome especially because i don't want to disappoint my parents) which i told myself, this is my new beginning i'm going to start again, study smarter and not stress out over things that haven't happened...   &#x200b;  firstly, this is my first time moving out abroad to a completely different country. however, so far i managed to fail 2 subjects already from the exams... and the maximum subjects that you can fail in your first year are 2 subjects or else you will not get to continue the second year. right, so after i found out i failed my 2 exams, ofc i cried my eyes out, talked to my sisters, then move on positively. recently, i just had new exams and this time i studied even harder and wasn't stressed in the exams room and thought i did well. the results came out and again, failed the two new subjects. i've been stressing so much over university when it's only been my 4th months here, but everything feels like its falling apart more and more... however, there are times where i only look forward and find ways to do better. but, these days i just keep having depressive thoughts and empty feelings... i'm so lost and its so cliche coming from an 18 years old... it may be easy for westerns to say its okay to drop out or take a gap year... but it isn't the same from my family. they support me so much and lift me up so many times yet i still can't get up on my feet and i just feel like a major disappointment.   i'm always the jolly girl and known to be a funny girl to many people, but i feel empty most times and usually blank out and question myself if the course (business) was the right choice for me. this doesn't affect me as much but the fact that my parents don't know anything about me failing subjects, it worries me so much because i don't want to be the first to drop out and to disgrace my parents and grandparents as i love them so much and just want to make them happy... i understand that it's my life but this is something i want always wanted, which is to graduate for them.    &#x200b;  to conclude all of this: i feel like i have created so many unnecessary problems for myself (mentally esp), my room has been a fucking mess for these past 4 months, i always feel like i'm depressed/stressed/ really fucking sad, i can barely get out of bed nowadays. i would love to know how i can maybe at least try to get out of this and hopefully pass my first year without having my parents to worry or be disappointed... people always tell me im better than i think or smarter but i just dont fucking see it ever.  &#x200b;  ps. if anybody would like to give me personal advice please feel free to slide into the dms (reddit), i would be more than happy to talk if you are willing to help

and the two giants in this style are undoubtedly laco and stowa. interested in seeing which people prefer, i googled comparisons between the two. across several forums between 2012 and 2016, it really seems that the overwhelming majority of people prefer stowa over laco. i'm really wondering why. my theory is that laco 2+ years ago was a little different than today, but since i'm new to fliegers i couldn't really tell you.   if we look at both brands themselves, they are quite similar. both are from the early 20th century, and both were commissioned by the luftwaffe to create watches for their pilots and observers. both are quite proud of this heritage and sport their iconic fliegers as the face of their brand. they're both in germany and appear to maintain a roughly equal standard of production. both seem to prefer to conduct business through their websites with only a small number of authorized dealers.   the only significant difference between the brands appears to be that laco offers significantly more variety with their fliegers, selling them in all different shapes, sizes, and colors. stowa has more styles available, rather than mainly just fliegers. laco also appears to be three tiers of pricing. the highest for replicas of the originals, a mid-tier for watches inspired by the replicas, and a \"budget\" tier which use miyota movements and forgoe the blued hands.  stowa prices are fairly consistent across different models and styles.   okay, if the brands are quite similar, then the difference between the two has to come down to the watches, right? well this is where the confusion really starts. let's take for instance the [stowa flieger classic 40 baumuster b](https://www.stowa.de/en/flieger+classic+40+baumuster+b.htm) and the [laco speyer](https://www.laco.de/en/watches/pilot-watch-original/pilot-watch-speyer-39-mm-automatic).   both watches have:  * same face style (so-called \"b-uhr\")  * the exact same movement (before any in-house adjustments or quality control)   * nearly the same size (40mm stowa vs 39mm laco)   * same lume (superluminova c3)  * same water resistance (5 atm)   * blued hands  * sapphire crystal  * very similar looking leather straps   * roughly same price (832 euro + vat for the stowa, and 930 euro *including* vat for the laco)  the only differences i can currently see are  * clear (stowa) vs solid (laco) case backs   * case finish is grounded stainless steel for the stowa, and sandblasted stainless steel for the laco   * slightly different case and lug dimensions  * different crown styles  now, i know these are just two watches out of many that you could compare with each other, but i think it establishes that currently the two brand's iconic fliegers are relatively close to each other. take a flieger from one brand and you can probably find a near-identical counterpart in the other. the most important features are basically identical to each other.   so with this in mind, why does it seem that people prefer stowa? now, i'm not saying that people should prefer one over the other. i'm quite inexperienced and don't own a watch from either brand, so i don't really have a stake in this. judging from what i've learned, i don't think you can go wrong with either watch. i am mostly just curious as to why people's preferences seem so one-sided. the question can also be interpreted as: is there something i'm missing here? to me, they so close to each other that the differences should be negligible, and preferences would mostly come down to local availability or which slight stylistic differences one prefers. i would really appreciate it if those of you who have owned or handled watches from both brands can weigh in your opinion. thank you!", "NSFW": "False",

can get with sniping nowadays): the supremacy, twilight oath and fate cries foul  outside of damage and stability, supremacy and oath have better stats, elegy has 1 addition point on aa, handling and reload to fate cries foul.  but what makes it better?  availability: gunsmith. supremacy is a raid drop, oath is a rng roll from the dreaming city bounties/chest/cats. most pvpers don't grind pve. foul drops from pvp and shaxx, but its not as good as elegy. year 1 version can also be purchased from collections or rahool's legacy engram.  stats: best for adaptive snipers, further improved with scopes, traits, mods and masterworks. aa is not too high so you can become precise and not depend on aa. switching to a sniper rifle won't be a problem, but its also high for a quick bodyshot and clean up with a primary. handling is good and ads time is the best as well.  damage: 394 crit, 131 on a body. bodyshot + primary headshot will kill a player with non 180s hcs, rapid fire and lightweight pulses a full burst, adaptive and high impact 2 headshots or a full burst depending on armor. 180s hcs can 1 tap guardians with 2 resilience or less. 3 resilience or more will require 2 crits, so lunal's howl/not forgotten trait will proc to 2 tap nearby poor souls    a headshot against a super does 146, so headshot and body works with the rate of fire. and can quickly quickscope and arcstrider or melee based super to kill them or weaken them for a melee, grenade or primary  best rolls available and almost god roll i use to destroy my enemies  scope: sso-08. lowest zoom and lowers the zoom stat to 30 i think. increases handling stat to 60 from 47 (selected)  magazine: accurized rounds. increasing magazine size isn't bad, but some mags waste ammo on the magazine on reload or forever to reload.  more range increases aa at range, so with a short zoom scope that lowers range its great (accurized is selected)  best base reload and inventory  good recoil direction  traits: snapshot and moving target, they're ads perks so they're active 99% of the time  snapshot makes quickscoping and aggressive sniping better and helps in a pinch, and makes handling even better. (selected)  moving target increases aa and movement speed when ads. movement speed makes you harder to hit and strafing is more efficient, stacks with agility stat. also helps if your agility stat is low. extra aa helps for a panic bodyshot or a lucky quickscope.  (selected)  masterwork: handling is the best, followed by reload and stability. i got stability :(  handling mw ties elegy and the supremacy  mod: radar tuner or icarus. i use icarus cuz i'm a hunter main. icarus is perfect with top tree dawnblade and the dawnblade exotic chest that freezes you mid air when ads.  icarus was indirectly buffed: sniper scopes and center reticle moves less when jumping. low zooms slightly negate this effect, so icarus might be really good now!  new mods and masterworks are coming, so maybe there's a new mod or mw that's superior.  armor traits: regular/enhanced sniper rifle targeting, dexterity and unflinching are amazing;

it just awaits the response.      // utility function to wait for x milliseconds using async/await     const wait = ms => new promise(res => settimeout(res, ms));          let api remaining = 60; // number of remaining api hits allowed     let api reset = 0; // unix epoch timestamp for when api remaining will be reset          const queue = []; // queue of jobs to manage          // this is the main function that infinitely loops to process the queue     async function process queue(){       try {         if(queue.length === 0){           // if queue is empty wait a second before next iteration           await wait(1000);           return;         }                  // time left until api remaining resets         const time left = api reset -

and said she had paid september, october and november in advance accidentally along with the normal bill, that's why we weren't getting any bills since they were taking it from the credit. so she sends this scribbled pad paper with the amount for each month from july - nov... it looks like she missed jun, july and aug (which i quickpaid half the amount each month, but apparently she must have not paid the bills, idk). there's an addition for jun+july and another for july+august adding up to what \"must had been actually paid\" but apparently she paid triple that (?). she claims only one payment was missed so no late charges.  long story short, the actual problem: i said \"ok, i'll send half of sep, oct, and nov (that had been accidentally paid in advance) but going forward i'd like to receive the actual comed bill (that's in her name, btw).  next thing i know, drama tornado. *\"are you fucking serious? what part of the screenshot email do you not trust?\"* i explain i did trust it because i trusted she was paying on time each month, but if she's been paying every other month or so that might mean late fees i'm not responsible for. added that i'll forget the previous months but it's just fair for me to see the detailed bill going forward. she went on the defensive, said \"she found my scrutiny of her funny\" to which i said i wasn't and that anyone can miss a payment. she stopped responding. lucky for me i'm sleeping at my boyfriend's tonight so i can let her cool down.  i mean, it's just two adults managing a household and being transparent to prevent misunderstandings like this. it's not personal. why are people like this?!  **how do i handle this and how can i stand my ground, get the bill with least conflict possible?**  i have trouble with anxiety and confrontation, so the fact that she's a \"friend\" makes it very hard, as she's not being logical and she's difficult to bump heads with in the first place but also i live there and i can see her being awkward and passive aggresive and that just makes me miserable. how hard is it to give me the credentials to the comed account w/o so much drama? i'm sure if i mention any type of

linked to a global market. * add pets which can protect your base, assist you in combat, or provide you a passive boost for having them. to obtain a pet, they would have to be purchased or domesticated. * add mounts and vehicles. mounts require to be domesticated and vehicles will have to be crafted. these features will not only allow you to move faster, but assist you in carrying junk.

 ahhh, time will tell.  my (just black) pixel 2 xl 64gb has been an absolutely incredible phone, and after a year (and multiple drops) it still doesn't even have a scratch on it.  that fabric case was just enough protection, or the phone managed to fall in just the right manner to not take any damage, plus i've still got another full year of warranty on this wonderful device.  i definitely don't need an upgrade.  there's not that many features i'd be missing out on -- i've already been testing night sight on the camera (which is fan-freaking-tastic, btw) and having a ball trying to get someone to actually interact properly with the recently released call screening feature.  i'm not really missing out on anything, and despite getting used to the horrendous blue tint fairly quickly (which was much worse than google advertised) i've constantly yearned for an improved display.  so i did it.  fedex arrived just about an hour ago.  wish me luck, phone is charged to 100% and i'm about to power it on for the very first time.  this will be my first experience with wireless charging, albeit a bit overpriced one if you ask me, but i'm a sucker and grabbed all the extra google branded gadgets/extras for it.  except pixel buds.  i'm content sticking with my bose qc35 ii wireless bluetooth headphones.  never understood why folks have continued to be so up in arms over losing a silly headphone jack.  and it even comes with a dongle if you must wrap yourself up in wires while trying to use your phone.  but that notch... oooh, i'm certain nacho notch will be the first app i install.  can't decide, perhaps you can help (assuming you've suffered through reading this far down the post) -- do i use the cable and transfer all my data and such over, or start fresh and manually install only the apps i actually need and use on a regular basis.  i'm leaning towards the latter, to be honest, but was tempted to do the transfer once to see experience the process first-hand, then just wipe the device and start over, but not sure i want to make extra work for myself.  wish me luck, powering the device on for the very first time right now!  thanks for listening to me yammer.  the device is gorgeous.   you can just instantly tell when you pick up the third version of the pixel that the overall build quality is significantly improved and feels much more premium.  again, this is coming from a very happy and content pixel 2 xl user (on project fi) of the past year.  hoping for more of the same... just better.  happy trails.  and i got another fabric case in case you didn't notice in the (above) included image.", "NSFW": "False", "title": "oh dear, what have i done?

a few reasons.   * stun. stun is an integral part of the game, and has it's place, especially against defensive players. its a much needed tool. but playing against warden makes you want to heave your stunned ass through the window because they will shoulder bash stun you like their life depends on it. that's warden's kit, so not blaming the players here, but it feels like a cheap way to lose.  * next is the guessing game. the 50/50 as some people call it. \"oh look warden is shoulder bashing. is he gonna let it fly? charge it and hit me when i dodge? cancel and get a free guard break on me? oh what ever shall i do?\" it doesn't feel fair to lose a guessing game that's so easily initiated.   * lastly, why playing as warden is not fun. you don't beat your opponent, you simply win the little guessing games enough and get a few cheap hit on your opponent before the screen says victory. you don't get the same satisfaction because you are cheesing your way to free hits.   to conclude, i am not saying this because i have trouble with wardens. the characters i have the most trouble with are assassins, but when i lose to a light spamming orochi or berserker that feints like its going out of style (with hyper armor mind you), i know there was a way i could have changed my fighting style to combat my opponent. even when i'm killed by environment, i know that i could have positioned myself differently to not be in that situation. against warden, i feel like i just got hit cheaply a bunch of times and lost guessing games that gave him cheap hits.   it's a shame too, because warden is one of the coolest looking characters in the game. i love his aesthetic. i love the idea of a two handed sword wielding knight. but the sword is a secondary tool compared to that god forsaken shoulder.   before you say it, yes i am one salty motherfucker, and yes i am not the best at the game. i am an average player that hates warden's kit.", "NSFW": "False", "title": "warden is the \"no fun\" character"}, {"text": "do i have to kill myst case everyday to access the shop?", "NSFW": "False", "title": "question about greedy shop"}, {"text": "i want headphones/ear buds built with longevity in mind", "NSFW": "False", "title": "heads phone built nokia style"}, {"text": "hello,  as the title suggest its one of those questions yet again that has been done to death. i'm wondering are there any cheap shipment companies that can handle shipping large batches of baby formula from uk to china?

[according to this source](https://blog.datawrapper.de/weekly-chart-gini/), which uses oecd data from 2014, the difference between the pre-tax gini index and after-tax gini index can be large or small. for example, the pre-tax index in finland was 0.5 in 2014, but the after-tax index was 0.29. the differences in korea, turkey and mexico, however, were comparatively tiny - the pre- and after- tax indices were 0.34 to 0.3 in korea, 0.42 to 0.4 in turkey, and 0.48 to 0.46 in mexico, respectively.  so, based on my naive understanding of this data, it seems to me like finland has done a great job of reducing income inequality through taxation and welfare spending. whereas korea, turkey and mexico have not significantly reduced their gini index and therefore have not effectively used taxation and welfare to reduce income inequality.  now here's my question: is my understanding accurate in this situation? does the difference between the pre-tax gini index and post-tax gini index have anything to say about whether taxation and transfer spending are effective ways of addressing income inequality? or are there too many other factors here to make a definite statement just based on these two indices?
