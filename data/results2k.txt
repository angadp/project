[{"text": "'''  you may be onto something here. memes used to be simple. relatable. worth a chuckle. then they evolved. new formats, new tag lines, new content that was then turned into a new meme. then memes became increasingly meta and self reflective. they parodied themselves and the users who both made them and consumed them. they built off of one another. they grew. they morphed into something entirely novel. this progressed to the point where even that wasn't enough. they had to become something more than themselves. they became surreal. they became deep fried and nuked. each flavor building off of the last and transforming into a nearly intangible, unknown entity. art progressed in a similar fashion. started off simple, i'm talking cave drawing simple. then some pottery and some small abstract sculptures. subjects everyone could relate to and understand. then, as technology allowed for the creation of cultures and societies, art began to reflect that change and it evolved along with it. by the ancient greeks and romans, art had become a more advanced version of the stone and bronze age arts. better drawings, paintings, and the addition of mosaics. sculptures eventually shifted from stylistic expression to naturalistic representation. still accessible to everyone, yet more nuanced and complex. after the fall of rome art stagnated and didn't change very much for nearly a millennium. early christian art dominated for the most part, consisting of murals and frescos and simple statues. all of which were based on the ancient styles. romanesque and gothic art also built upon these precedents. this all changed when the renaissance attacked. a cultural explosion changed the art world forever; arguably starting with the italian artist, giotto. he began using techniques like foreshortening and linear perspective so that the material world could be represented as it appeared to us. a callback to the naturalistic stylings of the greeks. almost like a reference to the days of yore. a celebration of how art used to be, but with the explosion of new techniques and technologies, the art grew increasingly diverse. new and improved frescoes, meticulously crafted sculptures, architectural marvels and the inclusion of new materials in these works. instead of tempera, oil was introduced along with new styles of depicting light and shadow through sfumato and chiaroscuro. these techniques and stylistic changes, while impressive, were simply an advancement of pre established art. the renaissance paved the way for the explosion and diversification of dozens of art movements that followed. from prehistoric art to the end of the renaissance, art was mostly about the same subjects and used similar techniques to accomplish the goal of producing a work of art. yes, the technical proficiency exponentially improved but considering the centuries in between, few true advancements were made. compare this to memes. they were so simple at first and really were nothing more. then they got better. more technical. more circumstantial. more media to create them with. but memes could last years or many months before dying off. as time went on, the longevity of a meme shortened. this is paralleled in the art world. after the renaissance the baroque period started. then the neo-classicism, romantic, realism, and impressionism movements not long after. still utilizing the same technical process but the reasoning behind the movements changed. no longer was it about simply depicting the world around us, it was about prompting the viewer to consider new thoughts and ideas. urging them to look past the image and think deeper about meaning and context. pushing the boundaries of what art could be. the baroque to impressionism era spanned roughly 300 years. compare that to the thousands of years between archaic art and the renaissance. it was a huge explosion of self expression. finally, in the mid to late 19th century starting with post-impressionism, modern art emerged. this movement focused on self-consciousness, self-reference, introspection, existentialism, and even nihilism. i'm talking fauvism, cubism, futurism, dada, abstract expressionism, and surrealism to name the most well known. these styles changed what art could be. they were no longer about depicting life as is, or layering a painting with hidden motifs for only the privileged to understand, they were in and of themselves absurd. abstract shapes, aggressive lines and colors, nonsensical dreamscapes. but it didn't stop there. post-modernism. pushing art to the limit of its potential. pop art, conceptual art, minimalism, fluxus, installation art, lowbrow art, performance art, digital art, earth art. these movements are about skepticism, irony, rejecting grand narratives and reason and instead embracing the idea that knowledge and truth are the result of social, historical, and political discourse and subsequently are a subjective, social construct. it's irreverent and self-referential. it's avant-garde pushed to 11. but what's next? post-postmodernism? metamodernism? hypermodernity? who knows? only time will tell. this is where memes are headed. they started off slow but have picked up so much momentum they're evolving at an exponential pace. they used to hang around for a couple years at most. then it turned to months. then maybe only one month. suddenly it was a week tops. while some particularly great memes do still stick around much like the masterpieces of art in the past, new memes are created every day, every few hours. new movements of memes are being created all the time. anti-memes. dank memes. abstract memes. wholesome memes. surreal memes. deep fried memes. nuked memes. even black hole memes, time travel, and dimensional memes are now a reality. what's going to happen next? a return to the classics? a new format so brilliant it steals all our hearts and then starts a whole new movement? i'm excited for the future of memes  '''  [context link](https://reddit.com/r/historyporn/comments/a158h9/comment/eaom5ff?context=999)  [go1dfish undelete

(however, the more i think about the more i understand why they count as tier 1 bursts: any more and it would be extremely overpowered. with every primal burst counting as a tier 3 a warrior would be able to have godlike sustain and condition cleanse during berserk mode.)  issue number two is the existence of a power trait. by this point everyone knows that berserker is a condi spec - far too many of its traits focus on burning and condition damage, with its weapon being torch which focuses on burning. by now everyone has given up on the dream of power berserker - a sluggish, unviable mess of a build whose bursts are so slow and unwieldy they are a straight downgrade from the core bursts for whatever reason in every single gamemode (apart from rifle gunflame cheese builds, which is just about the only way to make rifle half decent). much in the same way that i believe deathly chill harms reaper's identity as a power spec, i believe the trait blood reaction harms berserker's identity as a condi spec. since anet is dead set on pigeonholing berserker into condition damage, just adjust the ferocity into expertise or condition damage. or hell, make it a simple 'bleeds have longer durations and do more damage in berserk mode' trait. additionally bloody roar could be increased to compete with king of fires, as king of fires is better in almost all scenarios in pve. (issue number two point one: if holosmith, soulbeast, daredevil, weaver, and reaper are all elite specs that can be played as either power and condi, getting viable numbers on both, why can't berserker?)  issue number three is that it's not viable at all in pvp/wvw. both spellbreaker and core offer far more there. the few traits that berserker does have that *could* be good are just simply underwhelming - they all focus on defense during or entering/exiting berserk mode. that's nice, but what about all the times you're not in berserk mode? eternal champion is probably the only decent trait in the entire line for pve - but it's not viable because of  that very fact. compare it to spellbreaker, which literally gets a block as a profession mechanic complete with lots of traits. granted, this is because spellbreaker was designed for pvp, but even then core warrior is still better as you have to give up much less. core warrior can take strength, discipline, and defense, and as so can have a lot of damage coupled with a lot of defense, and in pvp discipline and defense are too strong as trait lines to ignore for warrior, as much of your sustain comes from those two trait lines due how they synergize well together. this ties back into issue 1: due to primal bursts counting as tier 1 bursts, this neuters the effects of discipline and defense. and i shouldn't need to say it - we all know how infinitely better spellbreaker is at duelling foes than berserker.  issue number four - and this is not an issue unique to berserker - is that banners neuter the damage potential of warriors of all specs.

live next to a house about 10 minutes away if you walked there. at the time i was around 6 years old. i had a group of friends who i wish i still knew to this day. we had a pretty strong bond between us and we always would hang out after school.     one day, i thought about going into the house down the street. it was exactly how you would imagine a house that was haunted. two story building with a brown color that was turning brown from how old it was. the grass was dead almost like satan himself would walk on that grass just to see the colors change. i brought the group with me because we knew it was abandon and we knew no one would really care if we went in because it was owned by the government for a weird crime.      i started to walk up to the house. the door was painted white and was wide open for anyone to enter. the other two follow me in my steps. we stepped through the door and it went from summer weather to winter has soon has we stepped through the door. we searched the main floor, nothing but the kitchen, and a living room.      the kitchen and living room were filled with spider webs and rat shit everywhere. after a few more minutes of exploring the kitchen we found the door that lead to the upstairs. for some reason it had a lock on it but it was frozen. almost like someone tried to freeze it with liquid nitrogen or something.      being the gamer i was i started to walk back and grab a wooden plank that was lying on the floor next to the door. i used all of my strength and brake the lock on it. it was surprising easy. i drop the plank and unhook the rest of the lock that was on it. one of my friends said he hears something, but no one else could hear it so we though he was fucking with us.     we simply say its probably just a bug or a rat. he said alright, but if it gets worse i'm leaving. clearly he was lying to us just so he could go home. we walk up the stairs slowly. it was so cold you could see your breath. i saw the female in our group was getting could, being the 6 year old i was i lent her my jacket. don't know why but i would always wear one.      once we hit the top of the stairs it was quiet. it was almost like you were deaf up there. we looked around and searched the place. i found a flash light on a box and turn it on. i yelled over to my friends and say there is one other one so if you want to take it you can. they didn't respond, and i couldn't hear them or see them. i thought they were just in a closet or something or went down stairs. i looked through the boxes and saw that there was nothing in them.      i finally got to a box that was labeled. it said something around the lines of *ze da'sa* or something like that (sorry was really young at the time can't remember quiet well). i opened the box and found a black note book on it. it had writing on it but it was scratched off.     i decided to open the note book to find... something that still haunts me to this day. a tall lady with eyes staring at me. the same lady was drawn on each page. i soon realized that they were in sync with each other when i moved the pictures almost like an animation. i placed the book on the ground and grabbed the pages with one hand and held the flashlight to the other.     my hands started to move the pages really fast so i can see what the animation was like. it was her turning her head and then going and pointing her long thin arm to the right of the pages. to the right of my was a box, it had writing on it and and arrow pointing up.     i decided to open the box to find nothing. my heart was racing because of this but it gave me relief when nothing was inside of it. i look up from the box to see the girl staring at me from the edge of the box having her hands on the box her nails cutting the box by grabbing it. her chin resting on the box has well.     she stood up has he arms and head move in ways that shouldn't be possible. she stood around around 8 feet tall. she touched the roof of the house and she pointed her arms at me with her long nails touching my chin making it look up to her. she was about to say something before a police officer drags me out of the 2nd floor and to the main floor.      he asked if i was alright and if he can hear me. apparently he saw it has well. he was terrified i could tell, by his hands shaking when he was grabbing his holster to his gun and looking at the door. at the time i wasn't looking at the door i was facing away. i hear a loud screech come from the 2nd floor and the cop pulls his weapon to the door.      i turned my head to see the same long arm grabbing the side of the door. she clearly couldn't fit through the door and had to brake her bones to get through the door. the police officer was speechless has she twisted her head around the door frame and fit her whole body through it. i saw her grab the police officer and break his neck with one of her hands. she stares at me and disappears. the book drops. i go to the book and opened it basically crying. the first page said \"look up\" its black letters covering the whole page.      i look up to see her smiling at me with eyes that were just voids. she drops onto me and i soon wake up inside of a mirror room. the room wasn't like anything i once saw before. it was more shattered mirrors that were being held together by something.      i didn't know what to do. i simply stayed there for at least a day. at least it felt like it. i cried and cried before my hunger finally got to me. i had to find a way out. i decided to see if i could see an opening in one of the cracks of the mirror. i found a light that shined through one of the cracks. i could see my friends walking out of the house through it has they were laughing and started to walk home. i screamed and started to bang on the mirrors has they all brake in sync.     i was upstairs once again. the book was laying in the same place i left it. i didn't hesitate to leave. i tried to go down the stairs to escape this place but it seemed the door was locked. i started to go into into my mind to think about something. i remember playing a game about breaching house has a cop. i started to kick at the door until i kicked the whole thing door. the house was old keep in mind, if it was new i wouldn't be able to kick it down. i ran out of the house to see a bunch of cops outside of the house and my mother and father. i ran over to them and hug them in tears has they said i was gone for almost 3 days.      i am 23 now. i still remember this happening. i decided to go back to the house today. i stood at the doors. it looked the same has it did all those years ago. i could still see by moving to the side of the door the kicked down door on the floor still.      when i was found the police officer was also found upstairs. they said his head looked like it was shot, it was suspected has suicide. they also said that his legs looked black, and almost like something has been sucking the blood out of his body.      i couldn't bring myself to enter the house. i kept getting ptsd about that time it happened. even writing this now has given me the chills and i don't want to bring myself to do this, but i have to know if what happened was real or not. i'm going back to the house tomorrow, i'll post more updates if i survive or not.", "NSFW": "False", "title": "the mirror room"},

(used to be a jailbreaker user)  based on the points above, all benefits of pixel seem not exciting to me, except the camera(still image).  am i right?  please don't get offended. i just see \"stock android feels so good\" everywhere and it really makes me want to try it, but just a feeling is not convincing and i hate to worry about my battery.   oh, i had a nexus 5 but didn't like it. does pixel have the similar feeling comparing to nexus 5 back then?

were in europe.   i footed the bill for most of the trip, dinners, massages, opera tix, broadway shows, the whole nine. i was convinced she was all in and this was it. there was a time, about our 4th country in, the sex started slowing down from a few times a day, to maybe once or twice a week. when i asked her about it she said she just wasn't in the mood. she became kind of distant, on her phone a lot more than the beginning, if i asked her about it, she'd claim i was having trust issues. i knew she had a lot of guy friends, and was still close friends with one of her exes. but i still never accused her.  we talked about the future, and plans to be together, future plans, future trips, we were all in.  after 8 countries and countless adventures and memories we headed back to the states. we were planning on going back to separate states with intentions on linking up once we got everything in order. i asked her before we left europe if she was still serious about us and the relationship and she assured me she 100% was. with that knowledge and reassurance i purchased us tickets and a hotel in nyc so we could spend a few more days together. we went to broadway shows and comedy clubs, museums and nice bars. knowing the end of our amazing trip was near we started to feel sad.   fast forward a few days, and i barely hear from her. maybe a short text here and there. no

parties we go to and we've both developed reputations. we've helped each other out in the past, like helping sneak partners into our house, or give each other a wingman, but never have done anything together. we're about to go out again this night, but both parties get cancelled, so we're stuck at home alone and dressed up to go out. we decide we might as well drink together and play a game of truth or dare to pass the time - and since we're both pretty competitive, we don't really back down and really up the ante each time.  revenge sex: both of us have found out our partners have been fucking around behind our backs. we go out to a bar/club/party a few nights after we find out to let off some steam and we run into each other there. we really hit it off - venting about our particular situations, flirting, and teasing each other. we end up going off somewhere (it can be as public or private as you want) and fuck around, sending our, now, exes pics/vids/audio of us fucking to get back at them.  cheating: we're both on our 3 year anniversary trips at a fun, caribbean location. the sex life for both our relationships has fizzled out quickly and we're both very bored with our partners. we run into each other at some point and as we connect (either at the pool, beach, club, etc) we realize what we're looking for and spend our vacation sneaking around to fuck each other senseless.  i'm a switch and i love rough sex (slapping, spanking, choking, hair pulling, and biting [both giving and receiving]), semi-clothed sex, semi-public/risk-of-getting-caught play,

scalable difficulty? how do you come up with tasks that don't become repetitive, but still escalate to behavioral modification?  keep reading.  **the basics:**  for starters, you need to know your sub's interests, capabilities, and interests. this should have already been done before you decided to begin your relationship. however, for any reason, it hasn't been done - do it now, regardless of whether you continue to read on.   behavior modification tasks are built around conditioning, specifically [operant and classical conditioning](http://bdsmwiki.info/conditioning). remember b.f skinner and pavlov? they are unknowingly the fathers of bdsm. these are the concepts you should build your tasks around.   **guidelines for building a task:**  * pick a behavior you'd like to modify or improve i.e blowjobs.  * pick a lesson reason i.e why is it important for your sub to learn or do this task. this is the mental component and provides a little motivation for the sub to complete the task. * pick a positive reinforcing stimulus, i.e masturbation.  * pick a reward i.e praise or orgasm * have a punishment in your back pocket * use time constraints, clothing, items, and materials to increase or reduce the difficulty. you have a lot of leeway with this parameter. this is your opportunity to really be creative.   **example:**   lesson: no place like home  synopsis:  when a man enters a house, he wants to be greeted to a beautiful  sight and an inviting warm feeling. your role as a woman is to fulfill  him. in order to execute the proper greeting, a woman must be nude  except for a collar and high heels. she must be on her knees with her  mouth open wide and her tongue sticking out. this is called whore's  pose. a whore must not only be comfortable in this pose, but derive  pleasure simply by being in it. no man likes a dry mouth and  uninterested whore.  task:  - strip naked, wear a collar, and sit on your knees on the floor - place a 1/8 measuring cup or small cup in front of your knees - have your mouth wide open, tongue out, and drool into the cup - watch rough face fucking blowjob porn for the duration of the exercise - rub your clit in the same position (no spreading your legs wide) - the task will be over once the measuring cup has been filled up with drool or 15 minutes has passed, which ever comes later - you are not allowed to cum, but must bring yourself as close as possible  **discussion**:  this task does a couple of things:  * it pairs her position, drooling, and blowjob stimulus with pleasure and images of blowjobs. * it serves as building block to move on to the goal. her drooling at the thought or sight of cock or whenever in that position.  * it is scalable in difficulty. we can modify her clothing, her position, the amount of drool, the time, change the type of porn she watches, and add objects like dildos or a real dick. these are some of the few ways to make it more exciting as well as reduce or increase the difficulty. * it allows her to    **conclusion:**  ultimately, you can use this as a guideline to modify any type of behavior, keep them entertaining, and constantly challenging. this is the approach we take to bdsm, which has worked well for us. even as experienced doms, there is still mountains of ideas and approaches we are open to learning. feel free to post your thoughts and ideas as well.",

couple months building a west marches campaign for 15-20 players. i've got a homebrew setting i'm happy with and lots of fun rules in regards to the frontier town complete with upgrades so i'm well on the way.  the problem i'm having is that i've been running a standard game for 5-8 players the last two years now who really enjoy the more in depth dungeon dive or mission. we've spent 4-5 sessions in single dungeons and players do seems to enjoy the occasional extended adventure. this is a play style that doesn't really lend itself well to a west marches game all that much since some new players won't always be able to make it (hence why we are moving to west marches). additionally, piloting two pcs is never ideal and i have too much on my plate to take one over.  now, my players are more than willing to give that up to be able to bring in so many more fresh faces. and obviously we understand that real life beats verisimilitude every time so we could always just ignore it and hand wave an absence away because it's a game that we do for fun after all. still, i can't help but feel like i want to have that cake and eat it too.  a very half baked idea struck me: what if i had an item that could keep the essence of an absent player already on the mission safe, inert, but still lend support?  in my head the absent character would transport themselves into an item (crystal necklace a la critical role perhaps?) and be worn by a party member. additionally, i'd love to have whomever is wearing it and/or the entire party themselves get some sort of boon for safeguarding their essence. this way the party shouldn't take much issue that a player can still partake in a limited xp gain for sessions they couldn't attend as they are mutually benefitting.  my thought is somewhere along the lines of increasing each pcs hp by the players level and giving some sort of class ability or stat increase in relation to the abilities of the player absent (i.e., a rogue who was absent may grant the wearer proficiency with thieves tools and stealth). ideally, i'd like this boon to be specifically things that character would be uniquely qualified for during the mission so it doesn't potentially ruin an encounter or cause me as the dm to make dramatic changes last minute to adjust for player count and available skills (especially at the lower levels).  i've been trying to work out a reasonably simple system that gives a solid boon and feels like the individual player themselves is still assisting from beyond but everything i've come up with has been too complicated to bring into the game, especially one with lots of newer players and lots of new west marches rules to make that system run smoothly.   so dma, what are some ideas you've got to help flesh out my

themselves.  the original series is all about loss, protecting those we care about, and how to cope when you fail.  we see this reflected in just about every main character.  adama is seeking answers to protect the fleet, but the ancient writings are destroyed.  apollo loses a brother, gains a wife, and then loses her too.  baltar was promised that his colony would be spared, and they're exterminated instead, and he clearly wants to hurt somebody...and tv tropes is probably right that he's not sure where he wants to stick the knife.  - speaking of apollo and serina, this is how you do a meaningful character death.  we're given five episodes in which to become invested in her and boxy, and their relationship with apollo.  and then, the episode ends with her death, and apollo and boxy being left to cope.  it's moving, proper drama, something that all too many families face in the real world, and incredibly meaningful.  - there's a degree to which this series is resonating so far in a way i didn't expect.  it's very much about refugees seeking a new home, and having to keep moving on.  with the refugee crisis going on in the real world, there's a lot that the original bsg has to say that has become meaningful again.  - there was a moment between watching parts 1 and 2 when i suddenly realized what the female viper pilots had to have meant.  it's easy to take them for granted now as being just how the world works and should work, but this was aired only 9 years after star trek went off the air, and only 10 years after that first interracial kiss.  having female viper pilots, including women of colour, as colonial warriors and officers had to have been revolutionary back then.  it's a pity that i don't recall ever seeing them again.  and that's it for now...", "NSFW": "False", "title": "original series rewatch comments: lost planet of the gods (part ii)"}, {"text": "i just got given gold from a kind reddit user, u/darthsylar12, for my dexter

(which is to say, the first part of the dlc, since it's broken into episodic format...), we are finally seeing a character that fans have known by name since acii, but has never appeared on-screen himself. that character is artabanus, better known as darius, a persian assassin who killed xerxes i in the august of 466 bc, which marked the first use of the hidden blade. darius later attempted to assassinate artaxerxes i with the use of poison (not sure why he didn't just use the hidden blade again, but y'know, whatever), which resulted in the king facing a lifetime of blindness. however, darius had still failed to assassinate artaxerxes, and the blind king fled persia. after that, we have no information on where darius was or what he was up to between the failed attempt on artaxerxes i's life and the events of legacy of the first blade.  however...what if we had access to the genetic memory of not an isu-descended eagle bearer, but that of someone who already understood the fight between freedom and corruption? a legend in the eyes of the assassin brotherhood? what if odyssey wasn't about kassandra or alexios, but was about darius? that is the topic i'm going to write about today. bear in mind that from here on out, odyssey in the way we know it simply doesn't exist. the story of the eagle bearer doesn't exist. all that we have to work off of is what we know about darius prior to odyssey, and the fact that his legacy carries on with the hidden blade, passed to bayek as the signature weapon of the assassin brotherhood. for the purposes of this essay, i'm going to do my best to keep away from too many specifics, and only speak broadly. we will be discussing three major aspects of the game: the setting, the gameplay, and the story/lore. without further ado, let's get into it.  &#x200b;  **part i: greece and persia**  in this hypothetical game (which i will be referring to as assassin's creed: proto or acp from this point onward in order to avoid confusion when comparing it to odyssey), the map would be split in half between part of greece and part of persia, with the aegean sea separating the landmasses and dotted by several small islands. as a result, the player would experience two distinct areas: the classical greek city states and the persian empire, both with unique architecture, civilian life and weather patterns. in the first half of the game, the player would be restricted to persia until about the halfway point, where greece would be unlocked on the map. this is because of the structure of the story, which i will explain later. sailing would, of course, be an important part of the game, and naval gameplay would be important for traversal across the sea. this part is fairly straightforward.  &#x200b;  **part ii: a man on the move**  this is where we will get into the meat of the essay. from here, i will break down the three essential parts of assassin's creed gameplay, in my opinion. they are **navigation,** the ability to move freely through the environment through the use of parkour and transportation such as horseback or boat travel; **combat,** the ability to engage and defeat opponents with fluidity, skill and creativity; and **stealth,** the ability to utilize the environment and the crowd in order to move through an area without detection and deliver a lethal strike to a target.  **navigation:** parkour and freeroam traversal in an open, 3-d environment has been a staple of the franchise since the beginning. this is something that i would actually carry over from odyssey for the most part. because darius predates the brotherhood proper and would be very much self-taught, he would be unable to perform many of the complex movements used by ezio and even altair. as a result, his parkour ability would more closely resemble that of bayek, who uses basic wall running, dropping, climbing, rolling and vaulting techniques. additionally (and this one is important), while darius would be able to synchronize with viewpoints, he would be unable to perform a leap of faith, despite his technical status as an assassin. the leap of faith was significant to bayek's father, sabu, and he used it in order to teach bayek to control his fear. however, because there is no information to contradict the fact that sabu and subsequently bayek were the first ones to use it (and bayek was certainly the one to integrate it into the brotherhood's rituals, which do not exist yet), we have no reason to believe that darius could do it. for that reason, no leap of faith. however, traditional eagle vision would return, masking darius' surroundings in a greyish hue and highlighting enemy forces as red for enemies, gold for objectives and blue for allies.  **combat:** the combat in assassin's creed games has gone through many different alterations, with the most recent change being the jump to a hitbox-based system with origins, and then the addition of a \"counter\" with odyssey. assassin's creed proto would feature a combat system similar to the one in origins. however, in order to reinforce the realism, there would be no elemental skills. in fact, the skill tree would no longer exist in the way it does in odyssey. rather, an armor system would be in place like a mix of that of acii, brotherhood and origins, with better armor upgrades improving your health and overall melee and ranged weapon stats (for example, each piece of armor, such as bracer armor, shoulder armor, chest armor, kilt armor and greaves would be upgrade-able). one thing that would change the game would be weapon selection and the hidden blade. similar to the older games, a flick of the d-pad would allow darius to change weapons mid-fight, between a sword-hidden blade combination where the armored gauntlet of the blade allows it to deflect and eventually parry attacks when the armor level of the gauntlet is raised high enough (would include a second weapon slot after buying the second weapon belt, again through an armor system); a long weapon or heavy weapon depending on the player's discretion which would not utilize the hidden blade at all; and finally, dedicated hidden blade combat. with only the hidden blade equipped, you can make faster dodges, and while the hidden blade can only kill by enacting a perfect parry (which means you can only make stealth kills with the hidden blade until the bracer armor is upgraded to allow for parries), it will always result in a one-hit kill (as it should be, in my opinion). this decision was really easy to make, because as the founder of hidden blade use, darius would of course design ways to use it in combat so that later assassins like altair could imitate his fighting style.  **stealth:** one of the fundamental parts of assassin's creed gameplay which has been lost in recent games is the use of environmental and social stealth. in origins, it was with fairly good reason. bayek spent the majority of the game as a medjay, the public protector of the people. trying to hide when everyone knows your name is silly. this is true of odyssey, as well. the eagle bearer is an infamous mercenary, and there's no way that someone like that can hide among the people. however, especially after darius inevitably travels to greece (which will be covered in the next section), nobody knows who he is. he is totally anonymous, and for a lone proto-assassin with no bureau to escape into, anonymity is exactly what darius needs. this would be heavily enforced in gameplay with the return of a notoriety system as well as social stealth. darius has to blend in and stay unnoticed, otherwise he is dead. he can take part in conversations, merge with moving groups, sit on benches (hoo-ah!) and even use freelance mercenaries as distractions with a quick tip of *drachmae*. he can hide in gardens, inside wells, duck around corners and even throw himself into haystacks. of course, all assassinations must be carried out with the hidden blade, but darius has a couple of tools at his disposal for taking out guards and making a quick escape. smoke bombs allow for quick getaways, and he can utilize poison bombs and poison darts to drive foes insane and attack one another. his long range weapon is a longbow, which allows for silent ranged kills. overall, darius would be a character designed for a stealth focus, but he can still get into melee thanks to an armor system and parrying.  &#x200b;  **part iii: the lone ranger (long read ahead)**  the story of assassin's creed proto would begin similarly to how other games in the franchise have begun, but with one key difference. darius isn't descended from assassins, because there are no assassins yet. he is inducted into the persian army around the age of 18, which is where the game actually starts. we start playing as a young artabanus, not much older than ezio was. artabanus learns parkour and swordplay from his time in the military, and at the end of the first sequence (i'm using sequences in order to break up the story, because everything just seems to happen all at once without them in my opinion) artabanus actually defends the king, darius i, and his son xerxes i from a group of wannabe assassins, and xerxes makes artabanus his personal bodyguard as a result. however, as the next sequence starts, artabanus learns of the cult of kosmos, and their plans to infiltrate darius i's personal advisory cabinet in order to control persia, and when artabanus attempts to warn darius i of the betrayal from within, darius i is actually murdered by a cultist in order to allow his son to take command of persia, as xerxes i was much easier to manipulate than the older king. as a result, artabanus decides that he has to take matters into his own hands, and over the next year, he designs the hidden blade, using parts he creates and buys as well as the dagger blade that he earned as xerxes i's bodyguard. the end of the second sequence is the fateful assassination of xerxes i in roughly 465 bc, where artabanus finally makes use of the hidden blade for the first time in recorded history.  however, things do not go smoothly. artabanus made the grave mistake of removing the puppet instead of the puppet masters, and now the cult knows of his existence as a man who may pose a threat to their plans. with the start of the third sequence, artaxerxes i, son of the late xerxes i, becomes the new king, who receives guidance from themosticles. however, hystocles, second son of xerxes i and new ally to the cult, believed his brother to be weak and quickly became jealous of him, and so he sought out artabanus to end artaxerxes i's life. artabanus initially turns hystocles down, but hystocles threatens to have artabanus' family executed if he does not comply. artabanus realizes that the cult knows exactly who he is, and thus he takes poison weapons into his arsenal, using an experimental poison bomb on artaxerxes. however, the bomb only succeeds in blinding the king, and artabanus ends up helping him escape to greece, taking mercy on the king and spreading the word that the king was dead anonymously. however, the cult learns of this, and the sequence ends with the execution of artabanus' family as directed by hystocles, who threatens to kill artabanus if he ever shows his face in persia again, in 464 bc. thus, artabanus too flees persia, and hystocles declares him dead after a chase that forces artabanus to leap into water far below a watch tower.  from here, the game becomes far less linear. after artabanus arrives in greece, he realizes that he needs to destroy the cult of kosmos. they had control of every aspect of the mediterranean world and needed to be put down, before their corrupt practices led them to tear everything apart. after involving himself with new allies, artabanus buys new robes and changes his name to darius to become the first recorded blade in the crowds. he begins to take down the cult one by one, and that's pretty much how the rest of the story goes, spanning both greece and persia. the biggest change is the revelation that hystocles has become the leader of the cult and now holds an apple of eden (specifically altair's apple), and he and darius face off in a classic assassin's creed boss battle format. the game ends with darius taking altair's apple to be safely stowed away in egypt, where it would be protected indirectly by the remaining members of the egyptian paramilitary force known as the medjay.  &#x200b;  **conclusion**  i write this with the idea of taking an already interesting and mysterious character in lore and doing more of what origins did, which was develop and create pre-existing concepts while still remaining true to the lore of the series, and this is the fruits of that idea. i know that this is irrelevant because odyssey already exists, but if i were making a sequel to origins in the way that acii is a sequel to ac1, then this is how i would have gone about it. if you made it this far, i appreciate that a lot. hope you enjoyed. safety and peace, friends.   &#x200b;  &#x200b;", "NSFW": "False", "title": "what if we played as darius? fan concept for a darius

  let's pretend we live in a society where your gender was tied forever to your birth sex. in this society, we would expect people to act within certain behavioral norms for their gender. they would likely be attracted to the opposite gender - but even if they were gay, we could quickly determine which portion of the population they were attracted to. so in one swoop, we can assume their gender based off their appearance as male or female, and from there we can assume their likely behaviors and who they are sexually attracted to. in a social species such as our own, this all seems pretty useful.   however, let's now pretend we live in a society where anyone can take on any gender, fulfill any behavioral norms they want, and be attracted to anyone with any non-corresponding gender identity. suddenly, it seems to me that the concept of gender simply reflects the fact that there are differences between individuals. there would be a gender for each individual, or at least so many genders, corresponding sexual identities, and behaviors that i don't see any use to gender as a concept anymore.   so, the way i see it, if people who are challenging current ideals of gender get their way, they at the same time destroy the concept of gender.   this is just an idea i've been toying with in my head. i'd be happy to have it refuted.", "NSFW": "False", "title": "cmv: if gender isn't based off biological sex, sexual orientation, or behavior, then it has very little use in society"}, {"text": "as far as i know i literally may be the best haiku artist who only writes about tits (also maybe occasionally asses upon request) in the game today. i'm guessing it's not a particularly overcrowded niche, so i maybe have to be better than like 2 guys who probably aren't that good. i'm guessing. what the fuck do i know?

so fast?!  in my last game i was in the middle of an early game war against deity level alexander when a barb camp spawned in an area i'd already scouted. within 10-15 turns i had a literal horde of horse archers and horsemen flooding me. there were so many they killed and razed a level 4 city with an archer in it, in a single turn.   i didn't *even know barbs could raze cities*. i had to divert half my army to the barb menace, and even with like 6 archer squads it was an incredibly hard fight to push through and take out the barb camp, and i ended up losing 3 or 4 archers. to a single camp. there were so many barbs they bled over into the war zone and started swarming some of alexanders units too. the barbs put up far more of a fight than deity alexander did  this happens every time a barb camp spawns near horses, especially if a city state or something triggers the barb camp and doesn't take out the scout.  early game you are so fubar if you don't immediately send your entire army to deal with it. if 2 or more camps spawn near horses, you just restart.  one game, me and my friend spawned fairly close to each other, and within 30 turns he had about 15 barb horses swarming over his cities after they wiped his entire army out, and  i couldn't even send help because i had 5 or 6 raiding me and stealing builders and burning everything i owned down.   early game, that's insane, barbs near horses are far more dangerous than the deity level ai are. by the time you've got a slinger out and on the way to deal with them, the slinger will be turned into mush by 4 horseman units. barbs normally only spawn a unit every once in a while, they aren't too hard to deal with. but horse barb camps spawn a horse like every freaking turn, it's absurd how fast they churn out horses that can easily wreck your slingers and archers. i like barbs being a threat, but i would rather them be a constant and consistent threat and still be relevant mid and late game, instead of just being incredibly dangerous early game if you are extremely unlucky. most games barbs are a total non factor, it is literally just \"if barbs spawn next to horses, rip your anus\"", "NSFW": "False", "title":

"i am posting this here because the newspaper mods comments and i want to rant.    rant:  i completely support equality in education. everyone deserves to achieve the level of education they see fit. however, reading this column makes me really concerned. i can easily see someone spinning this column to argue that women shouldn't be allowed to work or study especially after they have kids.  i am just going to say that i am from a country where women are not given any level of sex education. i missed the mandatory american sex education, and i had really no clue about sex education until i did my own research. my mom worked long hours in a factory before she became a tester. i used to do a lot of the cooking, cleaning, and i used to take care of my younger siblings because i didn't have a father figure in my life.  just for clarification because someone might attack my mother, my father became an alcoholic and left my family after my youngest sibling's third birthday. my uncle and aunt sponsored our family's journey here, and we came legally. i am really grateful to be here, and i am happy to legally be a green card holder.  i am not going to a good university. i am not making a lot of money, and i work a low paying job. i am pursuing a career in stem even though my family is putting pressure on me to marry early. i haven't had sex yet even though i am the same age anonymous was when she was pregnant. i don't have high expectations for my life. however, it is irritating for me because anonymous won't take responsibility for her actions.  anonymous is a model of bad behavior and of extreme delusion. i don't understand why all her columns lack the ability to take responsibility. it is everyone else's fault but her own. her parents sent her to america to have a good education. i am not sure if her parents sent her over by herself or they came with her, but america is not a bad place to be. instead of smoking or chasing boys, why didn't she fill her after school hours with sports and volunteering activities to feel less lonely? i don't know how it is everywhere, but you can talk with the teachers if you can't afford the fee to join a club. usually teachers are lenient. america isn't a bad country to be in, and there are programs like dare and concerned adults here to help you if you need it. it isn't turkmenistan or afghanistan. it is america.  okay. so her parents \"messed up\" by sending her to america. hell, they \"messed up\" by not telling her about sex before her seventh grade teachers did(?). okay. she comes to america. i assume she is living by herself without her family even though this entry makes it seem like her mom was with her (and i mean assuming her mom works until eight p.m. and the rigor of high school course work, it isn't that bad. high school is hard with honors courses and such.). there is a mention of siblings, but i am not sure where they are. taking care of my beloved siblings were a massive part of my upbringing, and i guess that is why she went wrong is because she wasn't close to her siblings. okay fine.  now she goes around, hangs out with men, and she finds a young man who is responsible (save in the department of using birth control like condoms which is readily available in cvs.) and marries her after she decides to keep the baby. okay. i assume he is also the same age as anonymous, but he might be older or younger. he isn't a perfect husband. wow. even after he defends her (doctor incident), supports her, and loves her, he is a bad husband and in turn a bad father (i am not sure if he is helping with the kid or not based off of this column.). tell me one 24 year old man who is a perfect father. hell, anonymous isn't a perfect mother, but that is her husband's fault in her mind. however, he is trying his best and is being lambasted online. okay. cool. now we go on in her story.  she has the kid at twenty, takes four years off (?) to raise her son, and comes back to university to pursue a degree in media studies. that is magnificent. her son anonymous or anonymous not be suffering due to this, but it happens with kids. up to five years old, kids don't understand the world well enough to correct their behavior without being told by an adult. they aren't self-aware and are little bundles of joy (and other emotions. however, kids are cute when they are happy.). this is fine. her son will grow up, and he probably won't remember or care unless he reads these columns.  however, she is still unhappy. and it is still not her fault. in fact, in anonymous's eyes, her situation makes her someone to be pitied and martyred. having kids is hard. huh. if only she had been educated about sex. oh wait, she was. you are telling me that in america where you can see everyone saying \"don't have sex until you are ready because of stds and pregnancy?\" anonymous still managed to become pregnant without any foresight about how hard it is? obviously she wasn't using birth control, and god can only imagine how different her life would be if her \"horrible\" husband was just an inch less responsible.  i only had a taste of what my mother had to go through. i never had to look a pregnancy test, carry around a baby for nine months, nurse a baby, and be responsible for a person's future. however, when we came to america, i was doing my homework, cooking meals and packaging leftovers, helping my siblings with their homework, cleaning the dishes (oftentimes immediately after a meal because adobo is hard to scrub off after an hour drying in the sink.), the floor, and the windows, scolding my siblings if they didn't help me with laundry or whatever task i had for them, and helping my mother with miscellaneous tasks. hell, sometimes, my mother would lose her temper with me for whatever she was going through and i had to take it. i learned responsibility from this. i learned that it is hard to be a parent, and i respect parents. once again, this is still while pretending that this message is not everywhere \"don't have sex unless you are using protection. be aware you can become pregnant or catch an std. pregnancy is hard especially if you are not ready.\"  i think what the daily cal (and in turn anonymous) is trying to portray is that it is hard to be a student parent. it is a lot of work. young women can face unexpected pregnancy if they are uneducated about sex, faced a traumatic childhood and have issues with self-esteem and understanding sexual boundaries, and are unwilling to terminate the pregnancy because they respect the life growing in them. however, all i am thinking after reading anonymous's columns is that she is entitled. i have zero sympathy for her experiences because they are not that bad. in fact, they are standard for a child where parents are working. and that does not excuse her behavior.  yes, it is hard to be a parent. but i am not reading the column of someone who is grateful for the support she has. i am reading the words of a woman-child. if at any point she took responsibility for her actions instead of tossing them on scapegoats like her parents, her husband, or her son, i would have felt some amount of respect for her. however, her attempts to elicit sympathy from being overwhelmed and tired (read responsible for once in her life.) are overwrought and disgusting.  no girl should be allowed to read this because this is a model of bad behavior. she talks about how people look at her and don't realize she is wild because she is cute to look at. she talks about her appearance. she takes about her weight and her course work. it is all about herself. anonymous's mom apologized to anonymous for anonymous becoming pregnant. wow. her husband is not an unicorn. wow. her son is making her life harder by being a toddler. wow.  she never talks about the pride she might have had when her son spoke his first words or how his smile set a glow in her heart. she never talks about how she is proud of her husband for changing a diaper without making a face or how he sings horrendously. that is what my mom talks about. she never blamed my dad publicly. she always says he is a good man. and my mom makes me want to be a mom when i am ready even though my mom had it hard. anonymous makes me never want to have sex.  for any girls out there. be responsible. it isn't cute to be a mother, be 24 years old and have the mentality of a 13 year old, and blame everyone for your issues. take care of your family before having a family. study well. if you mess up, that is okay. just take responsibility. talk about how much you improved. motherhood shouldn't be torture even if it is hard.  all i am seeing from anonymous is that she shouldn't have had a kid or she shouldn't have gone to college. it is not mom-shaming. it is fact. everyone comes from somewhere, and some families are worse than others. that does not excuse bad behavior. i would be mortified if my mother wrote a column like this because i would wonder why she had a kid when she wasn't ready. if she can't handle having a kid and being a student, okay.  however, she does not reflect positively upon children who have absentee parents who had to grow up early. mainly because she thinks she is grown up and does not realize how immature and delusional she is. don't be like her. i would never want my siblings to read this or any children as well. anonymous should be ashamed of herself for behaving like this. anonymous reflects negatively on women, asian women, and on asian mothers. as an asian woman who one days want to be a mother, i can honestly say 99% of asian women are not like this. grow up.", "NSFW": "False", "title": "rant about anonymous columnist."}, {"text": "hi! hoping someone might have a fix for

the medical consensus is wrong on this one and better conversion therapies need to be created. agps/aaps/rogds are a danger to our society and they need to be stopped. transitioning is never the answer for gender dysphoria and even death is preferable.

total shut-in. i'm from las vegas, nevada originally, which a lot of people seem to get a pretty big kick out of. i moved out here when i was around thirteen and bounced around so many times to the point where i've forgotten how many, but i've finally set down roots here in the quiet little town of norwalk. that's northcentral ohio, close to sandusky if you know where that is. where i go next just depends on what life has in store for me.   i've got long-ish blond hair. i've been told i've got the \"80's thing\" going on, which is cool, 'cause that's the kind of music i like primarily is stuff with that kind of vibe to it. 90's stuff is alright too. modern music i just turn the radio off. i've got blue eyes that i'm told are exceptionally pretty. yes, i am a big guy. full disclosure, i can look pretty eccentric sometimes and i'll totally embarrass you in public. i've been toning it down as of late, but you've been warned. but labyrinth is one of my favorite movies...   as i said, i'm a homebody. i live quietly. in my free time i think the best word to describe me would be a gamer. i'm kind of floating at the moment, actually, because nothing in particular has my interest. but the games that i really love are story-driven, or really deep, and there's not really an abundance of those out there, especially with any multiplayer. i think my true love gaming-wise will always remain the dark souls series because i can nerd out over it. no, not because i'm one of those jackasses who guffaws over how challenging it is and because \"git gud\" or anything like that.   aside from that, i do a bit of drawing. i'm hesitant to call myself an \"artist,\" per se, because i'm still pretty amateur, but i concede to having some talent at it, and i have made money at it too, but saying i'm an \"artist\" makes me sound like some guy who should have a pair of oversized glasses, a strange, colorful haircut, skinny jeans, and a starbucks coffee cup in his hand at all times while talking about some kind of pseudo-philosophical crap. i mean i do fulfill the pseudo-philosophical crap part, but it sounds pretentious sometimes! anyway, aside from that i've been mainly helping a friend out with creative projects, and working on writing ideas. used to do a lot of rping in forums and stuff, little bit of fanfiction work. been a long time, been wanting to get back into it. used to do cosplay, too, wouldn't mind getting back into that either.   full disclosure, i'm a sarcastic bastard. and i'm more than a bit jaded. i try to use my sarcasm as a form of humor, so even when i'm being a jackass it's not because i'm trying to be mean, it's because i'm trying to make you laugh. and probably failing miserably at it, but trying. i am a quiet guy by nature. if you hit a point of conversation that i have an extreme interest in or something that i can continuously hold a conversation about, then i can talk for a long while-- but i don't need to hear myself talk. some people might mistake me for boring because i don't speak when i don't have something to say. i don't believe in an \"awkward silence\" between two people who care about each other. right now i'm kind of floating in life.   i'm tired of feeling alone all the time. i am looking for something meaningful. i want someone to hang out with, make plans with, and actually wants me around. i need someone who can be patient with me, as i've still got a lot to learn and take a while to come out of my shell-- and willing to put up with me. i can be a handful sometimes and i know it. i want a real friend and companion. someone who'll make me feel like i actually know what love is. i'm a hopeless romantic. i put my all into a relationship. it's a strength and a character flaw. i like to be cheesy and romantic, and i like to give attention. and i am both a sensual and sexual person too, and my romanticism carries over.  i'm overly protective, and can be overbearing in trying to take care of people i care about. i'll harass you about making sure you ate today. i'll poke at you about taking medication if you need it. i'll do what i can to take care of you if you get sick. i'll try my best to get you to sleep and get a decent night out of it. when you get upset, i'll sit and listen to you and talk with you about what's wrong. i'll tell you i love you until you get sick of hearing it, because i say it way more often than i should when i really do fall in love.   i want someone to be mine. be mine, and i will do all that i can to make you feel loved and wanted, and make you love me just as much.", "NSFW": "True", "title": "24 [m4f] northcentral, oh - \"you remind me of the babe.\""}, {"text": "there is a lot of conversation about loot boxes playing on the psychological aspects that

to socialize as much as i'd like. i don't really talk to any of my high school friends because of the toxicity and negative comments that they brought overtime. i do have a group of friends online but i don't really meet them often in person because they're either in school far away or super busy. i do play a sport that i usually socialize within that group but they too are also busy with their lives and their partners.   anyways i'm looking for a friend that i can go out and get some food with, go shopping, boba runs at night, go to the beach, play video games, watch a movie or binge a tvshow/drama/anime.   a little bit about myself: i'm asian american/canadian, 5'8, average body/fit, short black hair, and dark brown eyes. i'm known by others to be funny, very kind, respectful, genuine, open-minded, non-judgemental, honest, blunt, and straightforward.   i also would be open to dating and a possible relationship if it happens, otherwise i'm not really in a rush for anything. rushing for a relationship doesn't end well and would be just a waste of time. i also haven't been in a relationship in about 6 or 7 years. it's not because i'm ugly or anything lol. i just been spending my time doing things that i enjoy and want to accomplish but for the right person i will be willing to put some free time.   i\"m currently in school majoring in computer information systems (cis), working part time for a private org, and having a very small business on the side. i hope in the future to work for riot games or a tech company in the video game industry in the cyber security department. on my free time i'm usually eating a lot of food, working out, playing sports, on my computer playing league, watching a movie/tvshow/drama, spending time with family and friends.   i understand there is a variety of people that could message. so whether you're a lurker or post on gonewild subreddits, fill free to message me. i don't judge or will try to stop you from doing you. i hope you're from la because i'd like to meet you a person some time but if you are from another state thats fine. i also visit vancouver, canada every summer, so if you're canadian it would be awesome

there are a number of confusing decisions here, like how you can't see literally anything you're *going* to unlock. the game, for some reason, hides all the stuff you're unlocking later. it's incredibly annoying being left in the dark. i wanna play around with the mp40 but i'm not sure when i'll unlock it. if it's unlocked all the way at the end of medic, it's not worth it, but i have no idea anyway.   the in-game ui however is fine. it does its job like battlefield 1. there are some nice touches like with the way you can see how players are draining their revive rate.  next, general stability. the game is incredibly broken and glitchy. lots of animations plain do not work. i throw ammo and bandages to people and so often it'll just not say whether or not i did it and i have to go by the xp counter. reload animations don't work sometimes, sometimes it won't tell me i've been shot by someone far off, turret animations with tanks are often broken, the animations for getting in and out of tanks is real glitchy, reviving animations are really glitchy, practically anything you do in this game besides shooting is broken in some fashion. i understand that this is semi-common in battlefield but this is a whole new level.  third, there are some just general stuff that gets on my nerves. first, why are there seemingly no gun attachments.....? this is really concerning. i cannot find a menu for weapon attachments so i'm starting to think there are none, though i wouldn't be surprised if it's buried somewhere in this absolute clusterfuck disaster of ui this game has. it also seems like this game lacks shotguns, as i can't find any and haven't seen 1 in game yet, which is bizarre. next, there are some noticeable missing guns. i haven't seen an m1 garand yet or a ppsh. again, i'm not sure, they could be in the game but just at high levels no one has hit yet, but it's just as likely they're somewhere in the burning rubble of menus.   gun balance is also noticeably terrible. smgs are incredibly weak right off the bat, with the suomi being the weakest piece of shit i have maybe ever seen in a video game. the buzzsaw is absolute trash. it seems like there's literally no reason not to use the ke7 too, the thing seems godly. the volk and gewehr are both good, but the m1a1 (which is in paratrooper configuration on a class called assault for some reason...) is ass. the lee enfield seems reliable. i've played a bit with the mp40 which seems incredibly powerful and the clear choice in smgs. so at this point i've almost exclusively used 2 guns. as a side mention, the pistols are now absolute shit. i used to run pistol only loadouts in battlefield 1 with the mars and the p226 or the cz on battlefield 4. now in this game it seems as if that's thoroughly dead.   next, the game doesn't explain much. spotting seems to have been unfortunately changed (i loved using trench periscopes and being credit to team by spotting and this is gone now) to something that has 0 explanation for how it works in game. suppression seems to not be a thing anymore outside of lmgs? it could be broken ui though, but if it is, i haven't been told yet by the game.   next, another pet peeve, ***where is rush?!*** my favorite and almost exclusively played gamemode on every battlefield game is gone! i've substituted it with breakthrough which is fun but not nearly the level of rush. this is incredibly disappointing.   next, for some less bad stuff.  the ttk seems much higher which is quite welcome. more viable mid range fully-auto guns back in battlefield enables you to fight more than 2 people at once reliably, which is great. the game feels much faster than battlefield 1 but a lot more tactical due to the nature of the guns. i haven't died to a grenade or any mines or equipment or vehicles which is just lovely and something i've always thought would improve the game. the choice to have everyone be able to revive is really stupid and i would love for it to be removed but unfortunately it looks like it'll stay. i'm a medic main and the fact that you can revive your squad kinda hurts the purpose of dedicated squad medic player.   the maps are really big and not formulaic like some other shooters this year (*ahem black ops 4 ahem*). the guns feel really satisfying (the 2 of them that are good). the shooting is tight and responsive and feels just as good if not better than any battlefield i've played. the soundtrack is, as usual, beautiful and impactful at all times. i like the sadder, slower tone in a lot of it at parts.  there are nice little touches like dynamite no longer weighing what must be 900 pounds, forcing you to throw it only 6 inches, or manually using ammo/healing boxes so it's less confusing whether or not you used them with how long the radius is for use.   summary - at its core the gameplay is fun, tight, and exciting. there are only a few problems with the gameplay like weapon balance being bad and a lack of a proper gun pool and attachments. the main problem is with presentation. the graphics and ui/menus are both atrocious. the game is glitched to hell with animations and basic gameplay. the game feels incomplete and barebones due to lack of gamemodes and guns along with the general issues in how the game looks.   overall i think the problems will be fixed but this one needed a lot more time in the oven it seems. i can't even imagine how the game would've felt if it had been released as intended a month or two back. the gameplay is tight and fun but gets frustrating due to how bad everything else is. overall as a whole i think the game is downright bad and will lack replayability fairly soon. i'm sure the game will massively improve and be much better and i feel like it'll probably overshadow battlefield 1 and 4 at some point, and i'm happy to fight all the way in-game until it is.  **tl;dr** the graphics, presentation, and ui/menus are all awful and need time to be fixed. the gameplay is tight, fun, and responsive as usual and the score is phenomenal. the weapon balance is lackluster leaving only a few guns and there aren't enough weapons. overall the game feels incomplete and unfinished due to lacking a good amount of weapons, attachments, and game modes along with the severely high amount of animation/graphics/gameplay glitches. the game'll get much better over time and i can't wait though as a whole right now it feels kind of bad.", "NSFW": "False", "title": "first impressions on the game as a long time battlefield player."}, {"text": "i'm looking for a pc for playing games like warthunder, half life 2, insurgency, and garry's mod. no new aaa 120fsp crazy new games, i just want to run my games at a steady 60fps. is there anything in that price range that could handle that?

usa  state: maryland  &#x200b;  i would like to preface this with the following: i am sorry for how long winded this post may get, this seriously was one of the most tiring three months of my life.  so my girlfriend and i had moved into an apartment complex roughly three months ago. it looked nice on the outside and the staff seemed friendly. rent was cheap and was in a good part of town. about two weeks went by and we woke up to find out that my girlfriend's car was gone. we had confirmed with the apartment complex multiple times that the parking lot was open so we immediately thought it was stolen. called the tow company by the off chance and it turns out it was towed the night before without our knowledge. girlfriend had to get to work and i was already on my way so she had to uber to and from work. $50 bucks both ways. i called the apartment complex to find out that they contract the towing company and supposedly changed their contract from a closed parking lot to an open one recently and that i could get my car back for free but i would have to go pick it up. we thought that was fine, whatever. we would go get it and be done with it. my girlfriend called the police to try and file and report that our car was illegally towed but they said since it was private property nothing could be done unless we figured out who towed it. they recommended going to the tow company to pay for the ubers. once we pick up the car and get home, i am verbally assaulted by a neighbor for \"parking in her spot\". putting two and two together i ask her if she towed my vehicle the night before and she said she did. she eventually apologizes after we argue about it being an open parking lot but never once offered to pay for my girlfriends ubers. to finish up this part of the story, the towing company eventually paid my girlfriend.  &#x200b;  not much later after the towing incident, we found bed bugs. a few cockroaches too but they never really amounted to much. told the apartment complex and we set up three weeks worth of bug bombing. everything was bagged and placed in the center of the rooms. three weeks we lived out of trash bags since literally everything was bagged. we had to sleep in the living room due to my girlfriend being bit too much in the bedroom. during the bombing days, we were given no time when they would arrive so us coordinating around them being there and the 4 hour window to let it air out afterwards was impossible to work around since we were in the dark the whole time. we also own a dog and we had to put him in a kennel during those times and we would often have to leave him all day just we were sure it was aired out enough. we contacted the leasing office multiple times and nobody there ever gave a definitely answer on when orkin had come in to do the bombing. the final bombing day was scheduled on a piece of paper we were given by the leasing office and they botched writing down the correct date somehow so we had put our dog away all day for two days in a row. they eventually reimbursed us for the kennel after much prodding and demanding but the whole situation was awful. for those three weeks we lived out of bags and in the living room in a very small area because we couldn't spread anything out. we didn't bring the bed bugs into the apartment but we were punished for it regardless.  &#x200b;  during the bedbug ordeal, we found black mold growing on the ceiling. a week or two went by after calling them about it and nobody came out. the mold spot grew to about a foot across. finally, once again without notice, we arrived home and the mold had been painted over. i live on the top floor so it must have been a roof issue but it looked like zero maintenance had been done to resolve the underlying problem. they just went with the quick paint fix.   &#x200b;  somewhere between the bedbugs and the mold, my old phone was activated then shut off. it had been placed in one of the plastic bags with everything else in the apartment. i got an email about it but didn't think much of it since it had to be in one of the bags. after unloading all the bags and looking for it, it seemed gone. i looked for a whole week through everything. every bag was empty. no phone. it is an iphone and i put it to wipe itself if it tries to turn on again but i am pretty sure whoever stole it ditched it after they saw they couldn't unlock it. since both orkin and the apartment complex staff were in there during that time, i have no idea who could have taken it. i brought it up with the complex and they \"asked\" their people if they took it and they said no. duh, right?  &#x200b;  a week after all of that, our water heater went out and we had cold water for a weekend and no water for a whole day. they said they were going to get a new water heart for us since this one was causing problems. unfortunately i do not have an end to this story because we are not quite sure if we ever got a new water heater or not. the water started working fine after the no water day and that was the end of that.  &#x200b;  after sending them long emails after every single issue we had, only getting longer after each one, they finally let us break the lease and move out without paying extra. the water heater was the final straw for them. we were scheduled to clean the apartment today so we could turn the keys

place. this is why i am writing to you all now. what can i do? they entered my home without my prior consent to do remodeling that they couldn't wait one extra day to do. they screwed, no, *fucked* us over on so many other issues. we moved out and are staying a new place but even in the end, they gave us one last boning. is this something i can get a lawyer for? i am not even sure what i can do to get any compensation for the utter hell we went through living here. this whole time i was still paying full rent. they only ever offered to pay for my dogs kennel fees and that was after much argument and run around with the slimy office. i have a feeling they are going to take my security deposit. it was around 300 dollars. please let me know if there is a direction i can look in. thanks

sense to just use the loop instead of the hyperloop. loop, at 150mph will do the trip in 1.5 hours, which is better than a plane when you factor in the time needed at the airport beforehand and taxiing around the runway. also, since the east coast is dense, it wouldn't make sense to run a hyperloop tunnel between cities like that because you would either need to skip all of the cities in between (that's one long tunnel to pick up only two cities, when loop can hit every small city along i-95) or make so many stops with loop that boarding time will eat away any advantage over loop anyway. i suppose you could side-track the loop to solve this problem, but i'm not sure they're planning to have side-tracks on loop, and wait-time for trains would go up as they have to get out of the way of an express train, thus adding wait time that is subtracting from average speed.    &#x200b;  &#x200b;  i think hyperloop makes more sense for trips like chicago-nyc (800mi by road). a quick

nostrils. pain wracked my body. rage consumed me, his mocking words filling my head. i hardly registered the pain of my charred arms cracking as i lifted my twin scimitars. spitting congealed blood, i stoked the inferno which burned inside of me. this slothful creature would not have the honor of killing me. no, that honor would fall to my father or, none at all.   time seemed to slow. i closed my eyes and embraced the fury. it held me like a lover long scorned. i drank from its passion like a man lost in the desert drinks water. i was hungry for the power. hungry for the ability to crush these petty insects like the vermin they were. in a great flood, it came. it nearly swept me away.   my teeth extended into fangs, my wings went black as the void, my horns extended and seemed to burn with unearthly light. i could feel my soul strain with the beautiful corruption which oozed into every pore. i felt like a god.   faster than thought, i moved to intercept the cloud of harpies. they were fast demons, some of the fastest in all of hell. they were as sap dripping from a tree in winter. i hardly noticed their movement. i was the black wind of death. where i went, doom followed. harpies died in droves, they were dead before their brains could process exactly what had just happened.   harpies dead, i leisurely returned to my starting position. i could still see afterimages of where i had gone, harpies still had yet to finish their final breath before their respiratory systems could realize that the practice was now, and forever, unnecessary.  time returned to its normal everyday pace. every harpy in the sky, simultaneously died. some cleaved in two, an entire group was decapitated, and several who burst into a wet shower of gore.   belphegor slowly dropped his face-wide smile as the reality of what had happened sank in. i laughed in a booming cackle. the power coursing through me was astounding. with this, i would slaughter my father. i would claim the throne of hell! \"i will rule this kingdom and all kingdoms! heaven's gates will crumble and break before my wrath. the arch-angels will kneel before me! god himself will bow to my fury!\" my voice was the anvil of hephaestus. each word shook the earth and warped reality.   the barons all rushed me as i finished my exultation. they were swept away with a wave of my hand, they went roaring through the sky and ripping through the forest below us. i chuckled darkly.   rosier cautiously flew towards me, as he did he called out to belphegor, \"lend me your undivided power belphegor, let me end him with our combined strength!\". belphegor reached out with both hands, and a rapturous smile spread across rosier's face.   even with my enhanced senses, he moved in a blur. i found myself deflecting his blow with a grunt. a chunk of my scorched shoulder fell to the ground. the pain only served to stoke the fires of my rage. an orb of nothingness, black as space was black before light existed, formed between my horns. the orb blasted with unerring accuracy and hit rosier on the left arm. the arm evaporated.   rosier beat his wings in retreat, shocked. as was i, something had taken over...something evil was controlling...my fang lined grin returned. whatever, i would kill this cretin and be done with this. this very day, i would take what was mine. i would burn the world.   before he could recover, i launched forward and rained fury down on him. each swing of the sword broke more of my flesh. each swing of the sword wounded rosier. eventually, i knocked his sword from his hands and neatly decapitated him.   \"now for the ringleader.\" i said, malice practically oozing from my voice. i slowly approached belphegor. he was stunned, held in place by the terror only an abject coward can know. i snarled in wordless rage and readied another orb of nothing.   something cried out inside me... i recognized the voice. it was me? i...i don't...i let the ball go, it crashed through the leg of belphegor and into the treeline through the distance. shocked, the wrinkled demon fell from the sky, landing where i had left my companions. i needed to finish this.   i followed belphegor to where he had landed, i walked up the small crater he had formed with his fall and placed my sword on his neck. just as i was about to strike the final blow, a hand rested on my shoulder. i nearly decapitated the girl i had rescued.   i grunted and stopped the blade, a hairs breadth from her throat. \"do not do this. you are a good person. i don't care what you are. you saved me, and from what alexander has told me, you saved him too. don't let your anger consume you... i know too well where that leads.\"   alexander stepped to my other shoulder and rested his hand there, \"let us finish him. we owe you that.\"   i wilted. they were right. something had taken control. the rage left me as suddenly as it had come. where there had been fire, there was nothingness. an abiding wasteland where emotion had once sat, comfortingly. i fell to my knees.   alexander took the black scimitar from my hand, the girl took the other. alexander buried the blade in belphegor's throat, the girl plunged hers into his heart. i watched the last spark of life drain from the stunned prince's eyes.   i wept as i said, \"thank you. thank you both. you've saved me.\"   \"just returning the favor, my lord.\" said alexander as he placed his hand again on my shoulder.", "NSFW": "False", "title": "dog's best friend: the antichrist part 15"}, {"text": "how would you describe the beautiful boys style?

also believe that community management is also a very underpaid, undervalued field relative to the taxing aspect of the work, because it is perceived as 'less skilled.' i had this realization that i

believed in ghosts until the summer of 2016. some backstory: in 1968, my father's father sold his part of the family olive and lemon farm in sicily to his brothers in order to start a new life with his young family in the unites states. my grandparents, my father, and my uncle arrived in the us soon after and moved to detroit and began anew. fast forward to 2004, when my father went to sicily and bought the land back. he has since built a beautiful retirement home on the property; a still-active lemon and olive farm which rests in the shadow of a mountain on the outskirts of terrasini, sicily. summer 2016, my parents took me and my girlfriend over there for a month-long vacation. my father's cousin also joined us for two weeks, and one day after visiting ancient greek temples in the valley of segesta, we (me, gf, dad's cousin, and her daughter) were returning to the property to shower and change for the evening events in the town piazza. so i'm driving the car up the long and winding driveway towards the house, and i see the outline of a man who looks like my dad as we rounded a bend. cousin says, \"was that your dad?\" \"yeah, i think so,\" i replied. she and i were the only ones who saw him. we round the next bend, where we saw the figure - where he should have still been! - and there was nobody there. we both made a comment about how weird it was, but kind of blew it off as maybe it was just the sunshine or something. we park at the house and the cousin and i immediately find my dad. he had stayed behind to build an outdoor oven/grill, so we found him outside still. i told him about the figure we saw and without the slightest pause and so matter-of-factly, he says, \"oh yeah. that's my grandfather. he's known to hang around. i still haven't seen him, though.\" i'm getting goosebumps right now recalling the eerie feeling i had and that my dad's cousin was reflecting back at me. but as eerie as it was, my dad's next words calmed me. he said, \"he must be happy you're here. he wanted to welcome you, i guess.\"  so that was my one and only experience with seeing a ghost, and now i believe in the afterlife; maybe not heaven and hell, but another

as ceo, investors, professional athletes, doctors, lawyers, beauty queens, entrepreneurs, hollywood celebrities, fitness models, etc. these can lead to potential connections, dating and even marriage. in order to attract and retain such a man, it is important for a woman to shift her attention to her appearance.  &#x200b;  https://i.redd.it/ibjbbd6xh6121.jpg  you first need to sign up for a good online dating site, such as a celebrity dating site, which provide advanced dating features and a perfect user experience for the most popular [celebrity and millionaire

own photos and videos. remember, people with money may be attracted to your appearance at first, but it's your confidence and experience that interest them.  here are some things that women should do to get such a man. both women and conservatives look male, especially wealthy, looking for feminine traits. in other words, women should keep their natural looks clean and close. when displaying

should be conservative, feminine and beautiful as a whole. don't wear sexy clothes, such as miniskirts and high heels, as this can cause men to lose respect for you.  remember, men always divide women according to respect, trust and understanding. in other words, women should be careful when making first impressions. in case you have a tattoo, be sure to hide it because rich people are usually not interested in trendy tattoo culture. they like the image of a good girl.  you can make money by associating with people with money. you need to associate with people with money every day. the more you socialize with a man like this, the more likely you are to get a date from one of them. let your life in a way, you will always contact the rich, and will always be in their circle. besides, there are

(you can select the others if you need them, but they are not useful for pogo spoofing). then hit patch jar. the process will take some minutes. be patient.  then, in the same directory you have smalli patcher, you should have a new .zip file. you need to get it into your phone memory. then, you open magisk and install that module. restart the phone.  now, get appninjas gps app from the playstore. open it and enable privacy mode. it will promp you for a new name (you set one) and it will make a copy of the app with the name you took. now, delete original app, and keep only that.   go to developer options, and set the renamed app as the mock locations app.  open appninjas gps with your name, go to configs and disable system mode. the point of smalli patcher is to avoid it running as system app and messing up with the real gps (rubberbanding)   now you're set. enjoy your new way to spoof. it will treat the spoof locations as real ones when you're running the appninjas stuff, and you'll get the real one when is not running. it will work with other spoofing apps as long as they are not based on fusedlocation (read more about it @xda)  also, it's always good to remind you to

snailords (a.k.a. aidyn) is a popular illustrator/webmanhwa creator, best known for creating the \"nightmare factory,\" \"snailogy,\" and \"freaking romance\" series on webtoon. he is my personal favorite artist and i've been trying to determine his mbti type for a while now. fortunately, the open expression of his thought process acting as the core of his art and writing makes it easy to analyze his somewhat eccentric personality. after analyzing the contents of his auto-biographical \"snailogy\" series (which doubled as an excuse to binge-read it again), i have near-conclusively typed him as an infj.  the first two categories were by far the easiest to determine. the debate of introversion vs. extroversion isn't even a question. even with the numerous instances of introverted behavior and imagery shown throughout snailogy, aidyn has flat-out confessed on multiple occasions to having mild socially anxious, anti-social, and misanthropic tendencies. examples of this include metaphorically boarding up his door when he nearly attempts to confide in a human, having natural confidence while performing to a script and doing a complete 180 into awkward noises and arm-flailing when approached by someone after the performance, and leaving a restaurant without ordering anything when they were out of what he wanted and he would have to spontaneously determine something new to tell the cashier.  aidyn's intuitive nature is nearly as triumphant in comparison to sensing as his introversion is in its respective category. all of the comics he writes regularly contain strong fantasy, supernatural, or symbolic elements. even snailogy, a slice-of-life series he writes about his experiences and thoughts, is never fully based within the laws of reality. he also shows a skilled understanding of people's personalities and nuances, in spite of not exactly enjoying most of them, as shown through his innate skill at reading others (though not fully reaching the same wavelength at times) and self-taught skills in handwriting analysis. he is also incredibly comprehensive of more abstract concepts, a trait leading to his disdain for people who act on negative stigma (such as those who assume people who wear revealing clothing are \"sluts\" or those who ignore his preference toward male pronouns and refer to him using feminine terms in spite of it).  the final two categories were where i had the most trouble. in terms of feeling vs. thinking, i have determined that aidyn is more inclined towards feeling. he has mentioned how he \"doesn't do feels\" and would insist on watching horror movies over romance and chick flicks. however, in spite of this claim, his emotion-heavy illustrations and behavior expressed within his comics prove otherwise. he finds romantic dramas to be more nerve-wracking than thrillers due to the constant fear of the characters breaking up or something along those lines. in writing his characters for nf and fr, he displays superb understanding of how to create realistic layers of emotion in their personalities by basing them off segments of his own feelings.  the final category, perceiving vs. judgement, is most likely dominated by judgement. though he jokes about being a bit of a lazy mess, aidyn admits to being much more orderly than he claims. he is very task-oriented, putting school and work at the highest priority. he dislikes unfairly judging others, but when he sees something he views as problematic, he doesn't hesitate to boldly state his opinion of the matter. he has a firm set of ideals that he almost never deviates from, openly defending them and embracing non-harmful conflict when these ideals are opposed. some examples of this are his defense of the ideals i listed at the end of the intuition vs. sensing paragraph, calling out someone he was on a date with when they cracked a joke about a nearby stranger's weight, and offering advice to his followers by prioritizing his honest judgement over what the recipient potentially wanted to hear.  any other anglers (term for his fans and followers) here with your own take on milord's personality? is my infj verdict seemingly

network and basically says how important the output of a neuron is for the calculation of the next neuron. so the importance of a output.   the bias is also a number determined by the nn and is basically a threshold that determines if the incoming output of the previous neuron is \"important/high\" enough to activate the neuron.   the actual output of the activation function of a neuron, the weight and bias are processed by the sigmoid function and gives a value that is given to the next neuron.  the determination of weights and biases in a nn is optimized through gradient descent (or was it back propagation?).    pooling and kernels    the kernels in a dcnn \"scan\" the whole picture small area by small area and then gives it to the pooling neurons. the pooling neurons then proceed to check the scanned small areas for features that determine what kind of picture was fed to the dcnn. what i dont understand is why there are multiple pooling layers and what the pooling layers send to the neurons in the hidden layers.   sorry if my understanding is laughable and my questions are dumb, but i just cant wrap my head around this.   every help is appreciated!  thanks!", "NSFW": "False",

trees. it's known as krzywy las or the crooked forest. 400 pine trees grow crookedly. at the base, the trees curve and make a j shape and all the trees curve towards the north. no one knows how these trees came to be this way.  it's known that the trees were planted around the 1930s and around 10 years later is when the trees were curved.. the reason or even how it had happened is a mystery. one that may never be solved.  these trees could have been curved for convenience as the curve may have made it easier to make certain things like boats, rocking chairs, etc. it seems only 400 were affected, but it could be possible that the farmers were stopped due to wwii.  some theorize that it may have been a political statement. around the time that it was estimated to have happened wwii was happening. it may have done to make a political statement by local farmers. a similar statement happened in 1939 by planting larch trees in a pine forest in zernikow, brandenburg in germany.  some think that it's possible that during the invasion of poland in wwii enemy tanks may have caused damage. that possibly the tanks plowed through the young forest and caused them to flatten and grow the way they did. it seems unlikely that the trauma caused was from this.  some theorize that the trees were an act of nature.  there are trees around the world that have experienced this curve. except in those cases, the curves are rough and these are smooth maybe it was due to harsh a heavy snowfall or harsh winds. some think that it may be due to soil creep. the only problem with that though is that the forest lays on flat land. soil creep typically happens on hills or sloping land. or maybe they suffer from a genetic mutation that causes this.  between wwii and the 1970's gryfino was abandoned. it's understandable why no one knows why the trees were this way.   sources: https://www.historicmysteries.com/crooked-forest-poland/ https://allthatsinteresting.com/crooked-forest-poland-krzywy-las

  long story short, i found a solid deal on an r7 1700 and a compatible motherboard. bought them, and just got it today. upgrading from an i5-6500 for reference.  unplugging all of what i currently had was easy. i took out the old mobo, took out the ram to reuse (also ddr4, don't worry) and all was fine.  i placed the cpu inside the new mobo, lined up and pulled down the latch to lock it. i removed these two line pieces screwed into the mobo on opposite sides of the cpu, as the visual guide on the instructions said they were optional and i didn't want to mess with them.  i moved around the standoffs since i went from a microatx to a normal atx, though some weren't lined up because my i/o shield has a cushion on it that pushes the mobo outwards too much. a little force got most of them to line up, so i screwed them all in.  first thing i did was install the cpu cooler. it took a while because i couldn't get all four screws to go into the slots (they hovered over them) but eventually i got it. plugged the fan power cable into the motherboard and moved on.  i plugged in the 8 pin connector (two 2x2 connectors side-by-side)  needed for the cpu. i put in the fat 24 pin

did indeed plug in but i'm going to sleep soon and i forget.  fast forward, i plug in my gtx 1070ti, plug in the power cables and boot.  the fans spin, all the lights turn on (gpu, mobo, cpu cooler,

"hey everyone,       i'm looking for some advice and insight to whether or not this would be worth perusing through the courts.       my elderly/disabled father had a new shower room fitted a in 2015. in july it started leaking really badly, ruined his kitchen and has been deemed unusable by an emergency plumber as it's completely unsafe. he and my brother have gone through a lot of rigmarole to get the original fitter to take responsibility as insurance and a bunch of plumbers/bathroom fitters have all said the shower room was installed terribly and is therefore a latent defect.       campaigned to the original fitter to repair it for the last few months, all the while my dad hasn't been able to bathe. the fitter comes out and sees the damage after eight weeks of back and forth over it. says he'll come out and put it right. three weeks go by and no start date on the work, christmas is getting closer. my brother makes three consecutive phone calls (all voicemails that don't get responded to) over three days and finally sends an email to politely ask if it's going to be done before christmas. he also explains that my father has recently developed an infection which is likely from not being able to bathe problem areas properly, so it's even more important that his bathroom get sorted out asap, in case he has to be admitted to hospital and what not.       suddenly the fitter withdraws his offer to repair it and basically tells my dad to get stuffed. no excuses were given for why he'd withdrawn the offer. however, according to the contract he is liable for six years to repair latent defects, so he is responsible for fixing things. however, i think because i mentioned the infection and showed him video of the full extent of the water damage as it happened, he doesn't want to admit responsibility anymore because it's a heap big load of damage he's caused.       obviously this is now going to have to go through courts, but if we go down that road i have a couple of questions i hope you can answer...      **1)** would it harm our case to go to the press and watchdog or a local mp? i've heard this guy has possibly done the dirty on a couple of other people and i feel he should be exposed for it.       **2)** would we be able to sue for personal damages? as my father and brother suffered an horrendous amount of distress over this since july and he has now become ill as a result. it's had a serious impact on his mental health and not being able to wash has caused him to become very isolated. to pull the rug out on repairs this close to christmas too has really caused him to break down, he was suicidal this morning apparently, because even if there was a miracle way to fund another fitter to do repairs, it's too late to get one in now before the holidays when he was supposed to have family staying with him.       **3)** what are the chances of a case like this being successful through the courts? i know it's hard to say, but we have a lot of reports stating the bathroom was installed wrong and all the damage has occurred as a result of that. of course, he says it's nothing to do with it and everyone else is lying to drum up business.       **4)** my father actually recorded the fitter when he visited the property and all the phone calls made regarding the issues, including a lot of lies and phony excuses. during the visit the fitter was extremely evasive and nearly broke his own back reaching for excuses to dodge the compelling evidence presented to him. would these recordings be permissible?       i will be taking this to a solicitor but if anyone has any advice on how to resolve this before it has to incur legal costs, i'd be really grateful. my father can't afford the repairs and with the install being the fault insurance won't cover it either. he does have a legal protection plan that is likely to fund the court action, but i'm not sure if he can handle the fight as he is really done in from just getting

i'm told (my last serious boyfriend of over 2 years was same age difference). along with being handsome and fit, he's got a lot of money. he has a couple houses (that i know of), a $300,000+ car, etc- so it's extremely easy for him to get women but mostly women that would use him for what he has. i at least thought we had a great time. we laughed, we joked, had real conversation that wasn't just small talk. i thought we hit it off pretty well. we went back to his house, watched most of a movie. i didn't want to have sex because i don't do that on first dates but we cuddled and kissed and all that good stuff. continued to have good talk and he was super sweet and cute. he's a gentleman and just seemed like a great guy overall. he says he doesn't do hook ups, he doesn't like them but doesn't want to rush into a relationship, either and i feel the same way but when i'm interested in someone i like to text and talk in the times we can't see each other. i've texted him a few times and he answered back but never kept the conversation going. i haven't texted him today and haven't heard from him either. i don't want to seem desperate or anything so i don't want to text him too much, especially if he isn't actually interested even though he agreed that he'd like to get together again, he hasn't made any moves towards it.   my question is: how do i get/keep this guy interested in me? with all he's got going for him- he could have anyone he wants. but i'm genuinely interested in this guy unless something comes up that's a complete turn off of course. thoughts?   obviously everyone's situations are different and everyone wants different things. but is there any general advice for this? i just got out of a serious relationship and before that it was never hard

other treatment currently available. the other treatment is blood letting in the area and an oral anticoagulant, which can cause other problems. especially when you give someone an anticoagulant and

culturally biased. the realization started recently as i have been planning constantly and been torn apart recently for months about finding my own love vs going through with an arranged marriage. i have graduated university and have a very nice job, slowing gaining independence.  the reason for this recent breakthrough is my cousin's mother has spent hundreds of thousands trying to find a wife for him, no one she knew in distant family/friends wants to arrange the marriage with him or his sister. my aunt was even bribing millions of $ to some of the best women or men she knew to marry her children still no bust. my cousin is now near the age of 30. i feel as if his whole twenties was taken from him not just love life but also working the family business.  now i do want to make my parents happy, i do believe its selfish that they get to decide who i'm allowed to marry. my mother wants someone with same religion as her and culturally eastern because she does not want to end up like a relative of ours who is mother had 4 sons all marry western women who did not want to take care of the mother in law. in our culture it is normal for the oldest son to take care of the parents in their old age. i do know in my childhood my grandmother put a lot of strain onto my mother but they dealt with it as is tradition. note i believe this is my mother major fear and motivator, my parents don't really raised us with much shown affection and sometimes it feels like my siblings and i are just animals to them that will take care of them in old age and give grand kids. which is another understandable perspective.  recently, i started thinking that i want to be with someone i love and know. arranged marriages have a chance to be \"miserable\" but you work things out slowly because that is how \"we're raised and brainwashed to be.\" i know there are a lot of risk such as breaking up, wasting time, or even divorce.  arranged marriages only risk is not finding someone like my cousins in my opinion. i believe this removes the bitter sweet effect a relationship can have. the reason why finding your own relationship is tempting is because of possibility of bitterness its all more sweet. arranged marriages would in my opinion just be boring but i don't run the risk of disappointing them or suicide as my mother as threatened me many times with killing herself (a little manipulative lol).  sorry if the sentences don't make sense this whole ordeal has been tearing me apart for months. i want to know the best options and what is worth. i can go through with the arranged marriage and live the possibility of being unhappy or selfless. the other option would be to actually live a part of my human life that is \"true love\". i have thought of the possibility of finding someone that meets my parents criteria but i do have opportunities right now with people i am very attracted towards that do not meet the criteria. i am young and grateful to be very aware of the difference between lust and love but have little experience because of how i was raised being ignorant of anything other than arranged marriage.   &#x200b;  i would very much appreciate your guys

of currency. let's call it \"pocket cash\". this is the money you carry that's gained in small amounts from various activities. sell a pelt, loot a corpse, etc... you get some \"pocket cash\". you can't purchase this money through micahtransactions and it's only used for small purchases. food, camp, ammunition, etc... it's relatively easy to get and the main focus is to let help you maintain your daily activities in red dead online.   and red dead online needs a second form of currency. let's call it \"checking account\". this is the money from heists, activities, etc... that have a high pay-off. sort of like how in single-player your profits get cut between your take and the camp's take. now this is the money you use to order new equipment such as weapons, clothing, camp upgrades, horses, etc... and because rockstar likes money, it's what you can add to by paying for micahtransactions.   how does this fix anything? well, lore wise it still works. and more importantly it separates \"basic needs\" from \"upgrades and cosmetics\". by having a pocket cash system players don't have to waste their hard-earned funding on provisions and such and can keep playing and enjoying the game without such a hindered economy. allowing rockstar to maintain profits through their micahtransactions (i fucking love this word) by having a separate more difficult to acquire currency system for non-necessary purchases.   what does this also allow? gambling.  by having a separate currency that can't be purchased with real world money rockstar bypasses the restrictions on gambling in the game. which means cards, dominoes, five-finger fillet, horse races, shooting competitions, etc... can safely be added to multiplayer.   now, just to add an extra level of clarity. here is what your \"pocket cash\" is used for. this is the money you get from looting, selling pelts, and other small income sources. you **can not** add to these funds through micahtransactions or from your \"checking account\", this money is only gained through gameplay and no other way.  - provisions (food, ammunition, gun oil, bait, etc...)  - gambling (player-versus-player staked competition)  - daily camp fees  - vet fees (buying the horse should be a grind, not keeping it alive)  and here's what your \"checking account\" is used for. this is the money you gain as rewards from activities such as heists. you can probably get more of this by giving rockstar real world money.   - outfits/clothing  - weapons/weapon upgrades  - camp upgrades  - horses/horse upgrades  to keep a bit of balance, when you sell pelts/fish you have the option to add the profits to either your \"pocket cash\" or \"checking account\". this only applies to items obtained through effort and that can't be purchased at stores. so you can't buy provisions for \"pocket cash\" and then turn around and sell them for \"checking account\" funds.   keep in mind that the \"pocket cash\" money should be made much easier to obtain. increase the yield from sources so players can maintain their playing experience with more joy. keep the \"account checking\" at the current grind level to maintain profits (i guess, whatever) but at least give players better access to basic needs.   and i'm sure it's already been said enough, but the blip system needs a change. players with high honor shouldn't appear as

modes.**  so i'm not even talking in the sense that \"competitive\" as a mode should split it's playerbase into solo que and team que; i'm talking we should get rid of competitive all together outright, and have two modes that fill this void instead: **trials** and **competitive rumble**.  if there's anything i hear from the two sides, is that teams tend to miss their glory days of playing d1 trials elimination, and the obvious mass amount of solo players in destiny want an avenue to play pvp that has a little more weight to it. i'm sure there's the crowd that loves curbstomping some blueberries, but that shit should be saved for quickplay, because there's nothing competitive about it in the slightest. gathering as a team shouldn't be a reward outright in competitive modes and should only serve as a real boost in quickplay where things don't matter. alternatively all i hear is how solo players just want a way to play for glory rewards. whether or not these players can find friends, lfg, over come personal issues, and whatever other excuse, the fact of the matter is that there are a lot of solo players, and crazy that there isn't a place to house them properly in a competitive environment.  that said, i think we should have it like this:  **quickplay, rumble, weekly rotation, competitive rumble, trials**  **competitive rumble**: still normal rumble of 6 players, first to 20 points. glory is earned in this mode, however point gain and climbing in comp rumble is generally slower than trials. placing in the top 3 places nets you glory points, however 1st place gets the greatest amount, 2nd gets a normal gain, and 3rd gets you a small gain. the kicker is that placing in 4th, 5th, or 6th causes you to lose glory points, and placing lower means you lose more than those above you. 4th place a small loss, 5th a normal loss, 6th a greater loss. this ensures that people are actively playing to win and not just calling it quits if they're going to place 4th.  **trials**: trials as we know it, but now only elimination. i'm not sure if we should go back to 3v3 and probably stick to 4v4, but i think that's more a discussion for the community. however, i think the glory point system in this realm should function how it largely does now in competitive mode (the 5 win cap streak and all kinda thing too), though with an added twist. i think you should be able to ride your card as long as you wish to risk before you get your 3 fails. doing so and \"cashing it in\" before this will grant you some bonus glory points. this allows team to gamble and gauge how they wish on glory gains with the potential of not getting any bonus if they keep failing their cards before turning it in. this also allows elite teams to really snowball their triumphs for some fast climbs.  this is just how i'd attempt to solve the situation anyway. i just believe that we'll never get anywhere having solo and team based smashed together and consider it actually competitive in the slightest. add in how glory point score doesn't really seam to matter in matchmaking anyway, and we just have this frustrating mess we keep going on about. that said we should separate them. would be willing to bet that player population would rise considerably in each compared to the current comp as well. comp rumble only needs 6 players to que up opposed to 8, and finding a full team vs a full team for trials shouldn't be an issue as well; especially with elimination and the card/bonus structure.  anyway feel free to shit all over this, but its truly the only way i can see playing

it's a term used to describe an efficient approach to storytelling. chekov's basic idea is that if you're going to show your audience a gun in the second act, you had better use that gun to shoot somebody in the third act.  i'm no chekov. here's the gun:  a home buyer came to my property with express consent to perform pre-purchase inspections. during the inspections, the buyer's party decided to expand the scope of the inspections, without my permission, to include a \"$350 repair\". the repair work must have backfired (i contend) and now the buyer wants to hold me responsible for several thousand dollars in additional repairs.  from my view, things are clear: they broke it, they buy it.  let me please back up a bit. yesterday i executed a purchase agreement for my home. the sale price included generous concessions. i'm truly ready to be out of the place and i do not want to risk carrying it through the holiday season.  today, the buyer's party (agent, buyers, and inspectors/contractors) arrived to perform (1.) a comprehensive pre-purchase home inspection, and (2.) a pre-purchase sewer line inspection.  during the sewer line inspection, the buyer's party claims to have seen signs of the line needing maintenance. they then made a unilateral decision to attempt roto-rooting the sewer line. they only told me this after the fact.  i arrived to check on their progress in the midst of this work. the buyer's agent was unnerved to see me and strangely guided me away from the basement and outside the house to talk. his demeanor seemed a bit off, but he's a reasonably professional guy and i chose not to investigate at the time. too bad. i may have just missed catching them red-handed.  the inspections took longer than scheduled/expected. i returned to check on them a second time and everyone in the buyer's party was all smiles. they love the place! great. they reported the inspection went well, aside from the roto-rooting. everything seemed on the path to a timely close.  unfortunately, just after the buyer's party left my house i received a voicemail from my agent. \"they found a broken sewer line\", she said, and then recommended i begin making arrangements for costly repairs.  \"as you probably know\", she added, \"these sewer line repairs can be quite expensive.\"  i'll say. common residential sewer line repairs can run anywhere from $3,000 to $20,000 usd.  my agent acted as though i should bear responsibility for this repair. i have repeatedly denied all responsibility  i have never had sewer line problems. never had any sewage backups, sewer gas odors, or other signs worth being concerned about.  more importantly, i wasn't consulted prior to the buyer's attempt at repairs. i believe their repair effort went bad, and now it looks like the buyer's party may be conspiring to hold me responsible. they may have already convinced my agent i should be responsible. it's a tricky situation  my agent requested video or photo evidence from the inspector. the inspector declined to provide any images. that seems to be another negative indicator. i find it hard to imagine they didn't record any images during the inspection or repair effort. of course, the inspection was paid for by the buyer, and it's their right to withhold or (maybe even) destroy that evidence.  at this point, i'm afraid they may be looking for a fight.  thank you very much for reading. what do i do?", "NSFW": "False", "title": "does \"you break it, you buy it\" apply to pre-purchase home inspections?
