Some questions about your dreams,Hi,

I  once asked on AVEN (asexuality.org) how non-binary vs. cis vs. trans people dreamed and  what their bodies look like in their dreams and there seems to be some  differences, I'm curious about you guys. I am unsure as to whether I am  non-binary, agender or female.

I have been asking these questions on many different subreddits to compare.

I dream in an unusual  way, as I dream of myself in 3rd person (I see my body in 3rd person like I   am watching myself in a movie). Occasionally I swap between 1st and  3rd  person at will. I always know I am dreaming.

Here are some questions, I will reply to them below:

1. Do you know you are dreaming during your dreams?
2. What   POV/perspective do you dream on? (first person, third person, other    persons POV, not present/ feels like watching a movie, alternate    between perspectives, etc...)
3. Do you feel any physical sensations in your dreams?
4. Are your dreams usually realistic or surreal?
5. Do you have "super powers" in your dreams? (ie flying, breathing underwater, invulnerability, etc...)
6. Is your dream body different from your real one? If so, how so?
7. Do    you have any dreams where you start out as yourself (or someone     else)  then swap into someone else's body and see the body you were     before  through their eyes, then swap back again, and so on, and do you     ever see  sometimes both people at the same time in 3rd person? Do  you    alternate  between controlling either?
8. Do you control your actions in your dreams? Do you have any degree of control over your dreams?
9. How fast does time go by in your dreams? Is it like waking life, faster, or like a movie?
10. What is your sexual orientation and gender identity? (I think this manifests itself in dreams)

My answers:

1. I always know I am dreaming.
2. Usually   3rd person (I see myself from outside of my body while still    controlling it), sometimes 1st person, occasionally alternate, rarely I    am not present and I am just an observer and I remember having at  least   once "possessed" another person's body and controlled them.
3. No, I don't feel anything.
4. They are quite surreal.
5. Yes,   I can fly/float in the air sometimes, breathe underwater and I am    usually invulnerable. I can also rewind and change the future sometimes    and change the scene when the dream takes a turn I don't like.
6. Usually   my body is the same, but I dream of myself often in the body of  other   women, in a male body, in the body of some videogame character, as  a   fictional character or actor, some animal, etc... I often alternate  in   the same dream.
7. Not that I remember. When I swap bodies my body usually disappears.
8. I can control my actions fully, and the environment to a degree.
9. In   my dreams time seems to go by faster than normal. My dreams are  usually  long and lots of things happen. I can fill 2+ pages just with  keywords  when I wake up (I keep a dream journal and when I wake up I  just write  down the keywords to help me remember)
10. Female, hetero-romantic asexual.

KWA Kriss project,So I recently acquired a KWA Kriss in a trade locally. While my immediate plan is to sell it, I'm considering keeping it. I've got four mags with it right now, so its skirmishable. I'm wondering what parts availability is like for them nowadays - I know after it was discontinued parts were scarce. Anyone run one who could suggest if it's worth making a project of, or if I should just sell it?,False
