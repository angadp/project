freezing, the game ran poorly, enemy ai was glitchy, enemies/helicopters glitched into the ground, i just found the game a terrible experience. so when i heard online \"bethesda is not allowing refunds/bethesda rescinds refund offer for pc\", i thought well i can't get a refund so i'll uninstall the game and maybe come back in 3-6 months.  but if a refund is possible, i would really like to get one just because i was overwhelming disappointed in the product. does australian law cover refunds of this nature? i bought the cd key from greenmangaming. i haven't contacted bethesda or

me. when we met, she still had all romantic pictures/relationship status on her facebook page with her serious one. after few months, when we got serious in our relationship, she agrees to change relationship status, take romantic/couply pictures down from facebook but keep them in her laptop and assures that she has moved on from those feelings.  fast-forward few months, i find her texting secretly with one of her other non-serious boyfriend and talking about me and hanging out 1-2 times. we get into another big fight about commitment and her feelings, in argument i demand that she does not keep in contact with any of them and delete all the pictures with ex's, she deems this as over-controlling behavior, but in resolution she promises to have deleted all the pictures from her laptop

(i'm sorry this so long, feel free to skim)  &#x200b;  when i was 16 i started to get headaches. at first, it was occasional, no biggie, but soon it was most days of the week and month, progressing to every single day. i tried all kinds of treatments, beta-blockers, anti-inflammatories, prophylactics, etc., to no avail. nothing helped and they continued to increase in severity. i ended up at diamond headache clinic, discovering the one drug that helped was dhe (dihydroergotamine). but it would only stop the cycle of headaches for a few months, and i ended up going back again within a year. since i had been just managing my pain with lifestyle changes and dhe injections as needed. although, honestly i've just been pushing through the pain for years.  &#x200b;  then, when i was at my healthiest the last semester of my senior year of high school, i suddenly became very sick. before i was a state-bound long-distance runner, then one day i got out of bed and suddenly became so lightheaded and out of breath walking (10 ft) to my bathroom that i had to lay down on the floor. it continued every morning for months, i had to give up all athletics and missed the majority of the rest of the school year. i was so tired all the time. i could barely walk in between classes without feeling out of breath and dizzy. i couldn't focus. after i graduated my doctor diagnosed me with pots which fit at the time. it fit at the time, but i had an instinct that the beta-blockers i was on were aggravating the symptoms. i felt worse after taking them every day. so i stopped taking them. my symptoms became 90% better. i was able to function again at least as i was before the pots diagnosis for the most part. after that, i would get light headed and out of breath every once in a while, but with lifestyle changes, i managed it pretty well. since i have avoided going on new medications due to fear they would make my symptoms worse again.   &#x200b;  the beginning of my third year, i was exhausted trying to push through my headache pain and fatigue every day, and finally sought help. i was in pain every day. i was irritable. i was tired all the time, never felt rested after sleep. my doctor diagnosed me with depression and prescribed zoloft. the first week of the zoloft i was like a zombie. the brain fog was awful. but the next coming weeks i felt great. i was only having mild headaches maybe 10 times a month that went away with aleve, i was sleeping and feeling more rested. it was bliss, but it did not last long. everything came back a couple months later, so they upped my dose. the brain fog was terrible for a while but leveled out soon, but i didn't feel nearly as good as when i started my first dose. i continued to take it though, and my headaches were still less frequent and sever so i counted my blessings. finally, i was as healthy as i'd been in years. i got a great job, worked a ton, hiked, fished, and was doing very well. after a couple of months, the pots-type symptoms came back.  &#x200b;  at first, we thought it was just a pots flare up. i went to the er once after being sent home from work for being out of breath, lightheaded, nauseous, and fog-brained. the iv helped a lot with most of the symptoms, but i still felt more fatigued than i would be normal after walking to the car. the symptoms continued to get worse every day, until i couldn't work anymore. i couldn't go to the grocery store without feeling awful, then having to take a nap. soon i couldn't leave the house, or hardly the couch. i went to the er another two times because of chest pain, palpitations, tingling, and labored breathing worried about my heart. all my tests came back perfect. i saw a cardiologist who did all the necessary tests to check my heart but found nothing, and dismissed my pots diagnosis. every night i would be kept up feeling like my heart was racing, i would be dizzy lying down, out of breath walking to the bathroom, and tired all the time. i just sat on the couch all day for over a month waiting to see a pulmonologist next. when fall semester came around i decided to try to go to class at least until the drop dates. luckily within a few weeks, i miraculously was feeling better. every day i got better. because of this, my doctor chalked it up to anxiety, sent me to a therapist, and at least i was doing okay in school now. eventually, i could even hike. i did have some anxiety issues, and the brain fog wasn't completely gone but manageable. again my instincts told me the zoloft side effects were the problem. so i weaned myself to a lower dosage. the anxiety went away and the brain fog was much better.  i was finally healthy again.  &#x200b;

was on steroids and all different types of muscle relaxers and other medications.  a week ago today his ankles were swollen like balloons, he could not grip anything, could barely sit upright and was unable to use the restroom without the help of his wife.  he had just spent 60 days inpatient in an assisted living facility while he tried the latest suggested treatment from his neurologist - stimulation therapy.  he had his wits about him, which would likely not be the case if the issue was neurological.    through all of this time he was unable to get his hernia repaired because no surgeon would work on him because he was so debilitated by this unknown motor issue.  after so much exhausting neuro work, the surgeon finally felt comfortable performing this surgery.  that surgery was 5 days ago and today he was able to stand up from his chair and not require his walker to balance.  his ankles have lost their swelling by 80%, his flexibility is back at the wrists and he can move his legs in ways he has not been able to in months.  so my question is, considering his uncanny improvement after this hernia surgery, is it possible that a 4 year old hernia can cause severely debilitating symptoms but not cause neurological symptoms?  his guts work, his mind works, his digestion works, he can breathe fine, he just slowly lost feeling in his limbs over time until he could no longer stand up.  is it possible an umbilical hernia can/could have caused all of these motor, but not sensory issues?  i am just an engineer, not a medical professional or amateur in any way whatsoever, but as an analyst, i can't help but correlate this elective surgery with his sudden recovery of motor skills.    he says he feels like he is better somehow, like he will eventually walk again.    watching him stand up, it looks completely different now than before the surgery.  before the surgery he was stooped over, relying heavily on the walker just to stand upright, now he has stiff posture and can stay upright for 5 minutes at a time.    what are the worst symptoms of a para or umbilical hernia?  nothing i have read about includes the symptoms i have mentioned.  thank you

losing the point. i was a healer and everyone else had died. i decided to focus on keeping the point when i heard the super-competitive guy scream at me \"no, no, no!! you go the fuck back and heal.

was fully aware that i could hear as well. with that said, we suffered some quick play defeats but it was mostly because of the awful players we were randomly being queued with who always ran in shooting left and right. as for my skill, i admit that there was a couple of new mechanics i wasn't aware of with some of the new characters that my co-players were apparently completely read in, but

&#x200b;  so does anyone have any tips on how to more efficiently acquire 5 star emblems, particularly piercing, precision, and luck emblems?  since the majority of most every team consists of dps units, these three emblems are by far the most needed in greatest quantity.  currently most of my emblems come from scouting (which is why i don't use lts to scout... don't need the oil to get top 10% in poc, and lts can only carry two emblems at a time).  guide says that artillery and tds have the higher emblem drop rates, but they're still limited in their ability to acquire two per scouting trip each, and events are somewhat infrequent and don't always grant 5 star emblems, the current one notably using shop rates which are terrible for trying to get 5 star emblems.", "NSFW": "False",

(for those of you that do not know how/why we even have those in the game it is actually an awesome story for another time) in 2035 or whenever we actually get the next zone, we will be having the same material overload we are now do to the duplication glitch. i have so much of the 5 star material that i wont use until the next zone. i do not use 130's at this point because there is no content in the game after pl 100 that you need them unless you are soloing pl 100 4x. if we have 0 necessity to use the highest material in the game because the content you have is so easy then why even have it in there? epic give me content and a reason to actually use / required to use end game material for actual end game content. so we can spend months/years farming in the zone that is not released so that when we finally get the 5th zone we have nothing left to farm unless we reach the 6 star mats at the end of that zone? when the duplication glitch/exploit was out i know people that have stacks and stacks of 6 star mats let alone 5 star mats and will not ever need to farm again. if you are one of those that were doing to duplication glitch then you probably have no desire to have challenging end game content.      &#x200b;  to close this out i want to say that this is not a hate letter to epic about how we lack end game content currently, but overall a long time player of this game expressing their concerns for this game. i would not of spent nearly 2 thousand hours on this game if i did not enjoy it. i would not of spent an hour and a half typing this up if i did not care about this game. these are the two concerns i have as far as me continuing to play this game for the future.     thanks you to all the developers that have helped with making the game that i play on a daily basis.     cv part 2 was amazing <3     deflexun", "NSFW": "False", "title": "my 2 major concerns from a \"veteran\" player:"}, {"text": "here is the [**amazon cheap yoga pants**](https://bestreviewprof.com/black-friday-deals-sales-ads-2018-amazon/).  i discovered this page on google. it is absolutely best option to find the deals, sales, coupons and ads. you can find instant daily deals and promo codes. this page might be really useful if you want to find great online deals. there are hundreds of offers from different stores.  the complete link: [https://bestreviewprof.com/black-friday-deals-sales-ads-2018-amazon/](https://bestreviewprof.com/black-friday-deals-sales-ads-2018-amazon/)", "NSFW": "False", "title": "amazon cheap yoga pants"}, {"text": "open to ideas. just bored and let's see what we come up with lol. kik chadwell777", "NSFW": "True", "title": "want to role play talking about mine ans/or your crush or gf?"}, {"text": "[https://www.instagram.com/p/bqu7ehwbwb\\ /](https://www.instagram.com/p/bqu7ehwbwb /)", "NSFW": "False", "title": "a comic about regular heels vs pole dance heels"}, {"text": "hi, looking for a tub of santa monica bay rum in the original white tub - willing to pay for it.  it was my sotd for my brothers wedding a year ago.. we celebrated again this year.. but the hotel staff seems to misplaced it.   its literally the only soap i have a connection to.  i'll do my best to meet your asking.", "NSFW": "False", "title": "[wtb] lassco santa monica bay rum"}, {"text": "for about an hour, without having to turn the engine on and using the car heating?", "NSFW": "False", "title": "what are some ideas to keep warm in a car during very cold weather"}, {"text": "i'm looking for a crime drama (or anything similar) with some romance, but not as the main plot. more like a side thing.  i've seen:  * hello monster * lawless attorney * city hunter * healer * man to man * terius behind me * the k2 * w - two worlds  shows i have in mind, but have yet to see because i read it has little to no romance:  * tunnel * stranger * signal  i will eventually watch these. i've read great things about it, but like i mentioned already, currently, i'm looking for a crime drama with some romance.   mydramalist: [https://mydramalist.com/dramalist/noface/completed](https://mydramalist.com/dramalist/noface/completed)  any recommendations would be greatly appreciated.", "NSFW": "False", "title": "crime drama with romance."}, {"text": "does anyone know of some kind of tool to assist in placing [this type of through hole potentiometer?](https://media.rs-online.com/t large/f7293410-01.jpg)  part of my job is to place hundreds of these. the legs are always spread a little too wide, so i end up having to bend them in a little bit, and even then it takes quite a bit of force to get them in. i'm hoping to find some kind of tool that will help guide the support pins into the pcbs. any ideas?", "NSFW": "False", "title": "tool for placing through hole potentiometers?"}, {"text": "i read the notepad for the \"music titles\" section of \"flat blue theme\" and i got spotify to work with displaying the name of the song and artist i was listening to, but the time stamp ex: 0:00 will never actually follow the amount of time that is left with the song/how far i've gotten into the song.      is there a line in the notepad that i'm missing to be able to make the time-stamp feature to work for spotify?

what's your gender? give us a general description of yourself. i'm female, 18.   is there a medical diagnosis that impact your mental/comportamental stability somehow? no.  describe your upbringing. did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? how did you respond to it? my parents are both either agnostic or athiest, and were not too restrictive in my upbringing though they were attentive to how i acted and how i was doing in school and consistently pushed me to be my best. i always followed my parent's rules, grew up being a goody-good who always strived for straight a's, and was always upset and disappointed in myself whenever i failed in some way.   what do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? do you like it? why or why not? i have a part time job as a checkout girl/customer assistance at a stationary/book store, it's nice when it's not too busy and i can get lost in my thoughts and look at books, though it can be stressful when people expect me to know everything about all of our products and books and where they are, and when people try to make small talk. at work i always prefer to clean the tabletops than serve people.  if you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? would you feel lonely or refreshed? absolutely refreshed, i spend most of my time alone anyway. being in my own little place without having to think about other people, their problems, the people that scare me, i feel very comfortable just dreaming about stuff by myself, it's the most relaxing place to be.  what is your relation with movement and your surroundings? for instance do you prefer a sport or outdoors event? if an outdoors event what is it? and why? if not what type of activities do you tend to engage in? i would prefer an outdoors event if i had to choose. i don't do any sports anymore (i struggle with coordination), i do like going for walks though and i used to (until recently) enjoy going for runs. it's nice to just think and walk and look at the sky, i find it refreshing. most of the time though i'm indoors doing homework or working on personal projects, and when i do go outside i just lie in the grass or something for a bit.  how curious are you? do you have more ideas than you can execute? what are your curiosities about? what are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate? i'd say i'm quite curious. i'm often thinking about possibilities and how much we don't know about the universe. i do also enjoy talking about philosophy and people's beliefs. i certainly have more ideas than i execute because i constantly either go \"this idea isn't good enough\" or \"this idea is good i should save it for later when i have the means to make it\". my ideas are usually outside the bounds of reality because i prefer to think about what doesn't exist (fantasy) than what does or can (although i do enjoy discussing things we don't know about our reality/possibilities). one of my secret hobbies is planning up planets and creatures and different worlds for fun.  would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? do you think you would be good at it? what would your leadership style be? i have been a leader for my scout group, and i'd say i was quite an organised leader because i felt i had to plan everything out very carefully and would bail on plans often if there were small pieces missing. i generally only choose to take on a leadership position if i feel those who would take the place of leadership are irresponsible, inconsiderate of other team members, disrespectful, illogical, or not confident enough to lead. most of the time though there are plenty more confident/righteous people than myself, so i don't feel qualified. my dad (who was a scout leader) says i'm more of a \"if we do this, then what will the long term effects be?\" leader than a \"i'll plan and manage the practicalities of this event\" sort of a leader.  are you coordinated? why do you feel as if you are or are not? do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? describe your activity? nope! i played football for 14 years and could never do any tricks and only played defence, as all i was good for was tackling people and kicking the ball hard up the pitch. i picked up karate briefly but found it very difficult to know what different parts of my body were doing and i forgot moves very quickly. i also can't dance. i do however enjoy art and do quite a lot of sketching because i want to be able to draw my ideas, but i'm taking a long time to improve because i struggle with making confident, accurate lines, i tend to be more sketchy.  are you artistic? if yes, describe your art? if you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. please explain your answer. as i said i enjoy sketching, i also have a drawing tablet and do digital drawings (of characters or simple landscapes) and i also very much enjoy character animation (though i don't have the skills to do it well yet). other than drawing, other \"art\" things i enjoy are composing music in logic pro (i play piano and drums), and making and editing films (i'm pursuing this as a career).  what's your opinion about the past, present, and future? how do you deal with them? i tend to say what has happened, happened, i move on from the past quickly because i know there is nothing for me to do about it - saying that, though, i do think about mistakes i've made in conversation that could've changed people's perceptions of me, which i guess is a worry relating moreso to the future because i don't want people to get the wrong image of me and choose to not like me. i don't really think about the present all that much, except for when i'm out walking and looking at nice scenery. as for the future, i guess everything i do is planned for the future, i aim to avoid doing things that do not have a long-term positive impact, but i do often sink into the pit of procrastination and get very stressed because i know that means it will affect what i have to do in the future. my first priorities are things that affect my future in a positive way, so that's what most of my time is spent doing, thinking about and (trying to) work on these things.   how do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? if you would decide to help them, why would you do so? i usually oblige as long as i agree that they do indeed need my help and that what they want help with is morally right. i help people when i feel that i have something to offer them, and when i don't, i will offer them a better place to go to for help. i help my friends with understanding their homework, but i don't straight up write their essays for them. but yes most of the time i do help people because it will positively impact them and it will positively impact me for feeling like i've done something good. i feel bad whenever i have to decline people of help due to being too busy or too anxious if it requires copious amounts of speaking.  do you need logical consistency in your life? to some extent, however i accept that my and other people's opinions and values change overtime so it is not unlikely that i contradict my own previous statements sometimes as i come to a better understanding of the topic and therefore my opinions on it change. if \"logical consistency in life\" is implying having a structured and consistent lifestyle, then no i don't 100% need it because i prefer for things to be different rather than doing the same thing all the time, however i do need some level of organisation in my life because i can't function very well if i don't have control and can't know what's going to happen.  how important is efficiency and productivity to you? i like the idea of it, though i know in reality good work comes with time and patience, inspiration can't be forced, so as long as the task gets done and done well at some point, i am not concerned. my work is more likely to be less quality if i try to make lots of it in a short space of time consistently, i prefer to let it come to me.  do you control others, even if indirectly? how and why do you do that? hmm, i guess i do sometimes control others indirectly? for the purpose of there being order, and avoiding conflict between people. i like to keep the peace and to do that sometimes it requires me to have some sort of control. i aim to do what's best for the group, rather than for the individual, so when it comes to group activities where some people want to do one thing and some people want to do the other, i will take into account each side's viewpoints and what outcomes will come of either activity, positive and negative, and then convince the group to go for the activity with the least risk of negative consequences, even if largest vote is for the other activity.  what are your hobbies? why do you like them? i've listed most of my hobbies already. (drawing, film making, animating, playing/composing music, walking, designing worlds and characters). i also enjoy writing, i often write to myself, write down ideas, and dreams, i also write a lot of lists for lots of different things. i like all of these hobbies because they get me thinking and they allow for my ideas to come to fruition, rather than just mingling in the back of my head. i enjoy creating things, particularly new (original) things. i'm also a gamer xddddd  what is your learning style? what kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses? i know that i struggle very much with learning from just listening to someone or watching someone else do something. i need to physically do that thing to learn how to do it or write down what the person is saying and re-read it to learn it. i struggle to learn or focus when there are people talking around me, when there's lots of noise, or when things are moving around me. i'm not very good at memorizing details such as names of songs, names of people, or where places/objects are (instead i remember song lyrics and melodies, faces, and what surrounds the place or object itself). this is why i always hated history in school because i could never remember any dates or names or specific details.  how good are you at strategizing? do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go? i'd say i'm very good at strategizing. i always break things up into manageable tasks, turning every assessment plan into a bullet point list of essentials and things i need to cover. i really don't enjoy improvisation because i'm never happy with my ideas when i first think of them and i have to rework them multiple times which takes quite a lot of time, time which i don't have when i'm improvising something. i went to a theater sports club at school once and couldn't manage to say anything that made sense or anything funny and just embarrassed myself, which was where my dislike for improvisation grew from.  what's important to you and why? creativity - i just adore originality and ideas and imagination, the fact that our minds have so much potential to think of things which no one has thought of before and make things that no one has made before just astounds me and i always wish i could be more creative. creativity never ceases to make me happy. honest love - being with someone who makes you unbelievably happy is a magical feeling, but i don't just find romantic love important; love for nature, love for people around us, love for existence - feeling love for everything good makes me happy. happiness - i think happiness is something i should always strive for because i have the ability to be happy and see the best in things so i should use this ability to bring positivity to my life and the lives around me as much as possible. there's loads of other things important to me but i don't wanna write too much, here's a small list: truth, honesty, nature, purity, openness  what are your aspirations? my dream is to become a film or animated film director and make films which connect with people on an emotional level, teach both young and older audiences valuable messages, and inspire people. inspiring people is particularly something i really strive to be able to do by improving my skills, knowledge and creativity.   what are your fears? what makes you uncomfortable? what do you hate? why? i have a very strong fear of inadequacy - i'm scared of not being good enough for my parents, for my friends, for new people, for employers, for teachers, pretty much everyone really. this fear of not being good enough causes me a lot for stress constantly because i don't feel like i have enough skills so i always feel the need to be doing something to improve myself in some way and i get very uncomfortable if i haven't done something to improve myself for a while. i'm scared of death and it causes me to cry if i think too much about it because i don't like the idea of mortality. i'm also scared of spiders like many people are. they're too... wiggly  what do the \"highs\" in your life look like? my \"highs\" are often in the simplest of moments, where i feel peaceful and connected to the world and feel truly happy. a few examples of the times i've had this feeling are: when i'm sitting on my bed in the sunlight coming through my open window listening to the birds and looking at the clouds, when i watch or see something that inspires me such as a good movie or song or piece of art and i suddenly come up with a bunch of ideas and write them down, and there was one time i was with my best friend and my boyfriend who have hardly talked to each other and i was doing something silly and they both said the same thing at the same time and i became overwhelmed at how much i like them both and how they both know me so well  what do the \"lows\" in your life look like? my \"lows\" are often times when i'm overwhelmed. this can be from stress of not having accomplished enough, stress of things i still need to do, being overwhelmed by people and their expectations of me, or just generally feeling insignificant and inferior. what this looks like is me crying on my bed alone and then eventually getting over it in an hour or so.  how attached are you to reality? do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? if you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so? as i'm sure you've gathered i do indeed daydream often and don't pay a lot of attention to things around me, except for, as i said, when there is nice scenery or art to look at. so i'm not very attached to reality, i love to think of things outside of reality because i get very bored of what's normal and often wish i was in a fantasy world where i could explore. i am not aware of my surroundings while i daydream.  imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. there is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. what do you think about? why i'm in this room, what i could do in this room if i had say some paint to decorate it, how to get out of the room... but then other then that, once i have accepted i can't get out or do anything, i'd just end up daydreaming about random junk like idk how it would feel to be an eel or something, just like i do anywhere else. wouldn't be any different to me being in any other room.  how long do you take to make an important decision? and do you change your mind once you've made it? i take quite some time. i'm indecisive and do indeed often change my mind after i've made decisions, thus i always make sure to be planning ahead so i can have enough time to make a decision and change it and change it again to make sure i've taken into account everything i need to know about the decision i'm making.  how long do you take to process your emotions? how important are emotions in your life? i don't think i take any time at all to process my emotions? i know what i'm feeling and why i'm feeling it most of the time. the only times when perhaps i'd say something like \"i don't know why i feel like this\" are times when i'm overwhelmed by things i know i shouldn't be overwhelmed by and my brain seems to skip over that as a reason for why i'm upset in those moments. takes me just a minute to figure that out every time. emotions are very important in my life, i feel so much and i think i'm pretty good at understanding my emotions and the emotions of people around me quite well too. i'd say i'm in control of my emotions, because i cheer up pretty quickly and i don't need anyone to help me when i'm upset, i'm very good at managing myself and seeing the truth and being happy for long periods of time. emotions are also important to me on an artistic level because i feel very specific emotions when i look at different kinds of art and i'd love to implement some of these complex feelings which are hard to describe into films i make in the future.  do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? how often? why? yes very often. i'm often scared of not being accepted for having different tastes than other people so when someone says they don't like something (which i like) i'll agree with them without thinking and vice versa. if i say i do like this thing then the person will feel a disconnect from me and with the few similarities i have to people around me, creating a disconnect is bad if i'm trying to make friends. i don't really do this intentionally, though - i'd prefer if i didn't care about this and could say how i felt about things without fear of judgement or ridicule because i think it's dumb to ridicule someone for having different tastes to you. the times when i don't agree with others are when, for example; they say something immoral, ignorant, disrespectful or wrong - i do correct people who are saying things which are morally wrong or incorrect but only if i don't feel hugely intimidated by them. another example is when the conversation is with someone i'm really close to who i'm not scared of disagreeing with.  do you break rules often? do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? if you do break rules, why would you? ok so i was a goody good as a kid and i do indeed follow the rules still as a sign of respect for the people in charge so that they respect me back and i can therefore get advantages to being liked by the authority. also when i was a kid i didn't know much so i always accepted that my parents \"knew better\". however, now that i'm older and can think for myself, i do indeed think that authority should be challenged if their rules are unjust, ridiculous, or not necessary. i'd happily break ridiculous rules as a protest, and since i don't value the respect of someone who gives ridiculous rules. other rules that i disagree with but aren't entirely ridiculous i would want to challenge but often am too scared to. i don't like authority as it reduces a feeling of equality amongst people, but in society it's necessary.  what is the ideal life, in your opinion? the ideal life in my opinion is a life where you've experienced lots, been through ups and downs, created many things, done things you're proud of, found love and happiness, and found what your personal purpose is and what makes you happiest. for me personally, it would be a life where i've succeeded my aspiration of inspiring people and creating lots of original things that have impacted people positively, and a life where i'm married in a very happy, long lasting relationship.  thanks in advance!!!!!", "NSFW": "False", "title": "could someone help type me??

booze. anyways, they picked me up and we started driving on the highway. s was driving and a was in the passenger seat, i was in the middle of the back seat. we were in a very nice white mustang. s decided to goof off and was jerking the steering wheel to make the car jerk back and forth. we were going 65mph. a did not like it, after she did it at least six times a finally told her to quit it. she stopped, about fifteen minutes later, she did it again and a was pissed. all of a sudden, we were in the air spinning and flipping a few times, we landed in a ditch against a fence and pole. they were able to crawl out her door. however i was pinned because the roof of the car was smashed in and i couldn't climb to the front. the car only had two doors. i had to wait for help to use jaws of life to get me out. we got very lucky no one had even a scratch. her car was completely totaled. turns out the reason she jerked the wheel again was because of a big rock in the middle of the road and a thought she was horsing around again and jerked the wheel back but jerked way too hard and too much. she was just trying to avoid hitting the rock.   after the tow came and police officers to take the report, the tow truck towed her car back to her parents house. they asked me not to say anything to anyone.. we hoped in a's car and went to the campground. i kept my mouth shut but told my boyfriend b, cuz everyone was wondering why we were four hours late. the parents never found out until they went home and saw the car in the driveway five days later. my parents were never notified until i came back a few days later and told them. they were furious the cops didn't call them.   this happened when i was 15. i became terrified to drive on the highway, i couldn't do it..i had to find friends to drive for me if i needed to go somewhere via highway. after all these years, i'm 28 now and finally got over the fear of driving on highways about 6 months ago. i always tried all these years but would be so scared, sweating, tense, etc. 6 months ago when i tried again all i could do was laugh at myself cuz it wasn't scary at all. now i'm always finding a reason to take the

\"service brake booster\". the battery gauge was below the normal level, between 9 and 14. drove back home and the battery slowly kept going down. airbag lights came on, windows wouldnt roll up at this point while driving. made it home, shut the truck off. came back to crank it 5 mins later and it wouldnt turn. just clicks.  took the battery to autozone to have it checked out. battery read 100%. it must be the alternator. bought that. duralast no spacer.  installed it on tuesday, cranked up fine. good to go. but did not take it to work.   took it to work today. cold start, the rpms drop below 500 after it cranks, makes sort of a vibration then it goes back to 650. which has never done before. drove it 4 miles to the first stop sign, engine stalled. cranked it up like nothing happend. drove the rest of my 45 mi commute with no problem. on the trip back home, after a cold start, the rpms dip below the 500 mark when i engage into gear, reverse. then drive. never did that before. when coming to a complete stop after driving, say for example, arriving at a red light, rpms dip below 500 again and back to normal idle. the engine accelerates fine, runs with no problem while its running, so its odd. another thing i noticed is that the engines feels like it \"brakes\" more when coasting. it always coasted very easily after letting off.   i honestly dont know where to start, so any pointers would be great. thanks for reading and hope to get some responses from you experts. thanks!", "NSFW": "False", "title": "2003 gmc sierra 1500 4.8 v8 symptoms"}, {"text": "this garbage occured in rivals in the last two days  https://reddit.com/link/a1cc5n/video/yuecqrg626121/player", "NSFW": "False", "title": "quick garbage goals vol.1"}, {"text": "hi, i currently make 70k a year as a junior software engineer in austin (i got hired after graduation with no prior field experience). is this a fair amount? glassdoor and indeed have very small salary sample sizes for the austin area (with cs job data), so i can't really tell.", "NSFW": "False", "title": "i make 70k as a junior software engineer in austin fresh out of school. am i making around average for the area?"}, {"text": "recon (attack)  m16a4 (31/240)  mk 14 (21/160)  beretta (16/90)  p320 (16/90)  frag x2  stun x3  recon helo drone (can be used in place of regular drones. similar to yokai and replaces regular drones. same functions as regular drones and can flash defenders. can be destroyed as fast as a regular drone)", "NSFW": "False", "title": "operation green light"}, {"text": "his voice and some facial similarities as well....his prominent upper lip.  it's pretty clear to me.", "NSFW": "False", "title": "am i the only one who noticed the spamley/bogart similarities?"}, {"text": "&#x200b;   i know it sounds crazy. but hear me out on this. it was my day off after eleven days of working straight, so, i figured i deserved a lazy day. i binged on netflix and youtube for a while, and after getting bored of those two things, i decided to go onto reddit.  &#x200b;  r/nosleep is my favorite community, and i frequent it quite a bit. it's hard not to get entertained on a forum like this one, and i've grown attached. i was browsing through the posts, and clicked on my umpteenth one, the enticement too strong.   &#x200b;  i decided to go onto r/twosentencehorror after browsing r/nosleep for so long. the fifth or so post down had an interesting title, so, naturally, i clicked on it. my name was in the textbox, but the rest of the post was jumbled and nonsensical.   &#x200b;  \"wnko uoy i herwe vlie, ouy em leespa likl elt blair whineburk.\"  &#x200b;  &#x200b;  my name isn't common, it can't be. i reported the post immediately after deciphering it. i was anxious for the rest of the day, unsure of what to do. i went into my group chat with friends and showed them the post. they insisted i was pranking them, offering no advice or help. i was frustrated and at my wits end with this dilemma.   &#x200b;  i received this message yesterday.  \"i know it was you who reported my post and had it removed. i will give you two days to resolve this issue. \"  [this is the post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/twosentencehorror/comments/a0gkq6/for every step i took an echo scattered/)  &#x200b;  after reading the message, reddit closed on my phone. after tapping it countless times, it finally opened. it went to the page where you can log in or sign up. that was weird, considering i never log out. i tried logging in, and it wouldn't let me. i tried changing my password, and it still wasn't working.  &#x200b;  i logged onto my second account to see if someone had hacked me, and there were a few pictures posted. the first few were extremely blurry, as if someone was running when they took the picture. i kept scrolling down and found a picture that was somewhat decent, and i clicked on it. it was a picture of a shed with graffiti on it, stating, \"i warned you. \"  &#x200b;  the more i looked at the picture, the more familiar it seemed. shock and terror took over, my entire body feeling like it was covered in ice. i didn't want to move, but i had to. after what seemed like an eternity, i got up and walked to my back door. on the way there i had turned on every light on the inside and outside of the house. i opened the door, and slowly stepped out back.  &#x200b;  there it was. plain as day, sprayed onto my shed. my ear perked at the sound of something moving around in my backyard. i glanced behind me ever so slightly. in the corner of my fenced in yard, was a black figure. the only thing i could make out in the dark was the bright yellow eyes. i squeaked in fear and ran back into my house, locking every single door and window in record time.  &#x200b;  i resorted to hiding in my closet upstairs, phone in hand. i didn't know what to do or how to feel. i only knew that someone was watching me outside. a knocking came from downstairs. it was soft at first. it grew louder and louder, until it sounded like someone was throwing boulders at my door. i quivered and unlocked my phone, dialing 911.  &#x200b;  i heard the sirens coming, and i ran downstairs and outside. \"you shouldn't have done that. you have been warned for the last time. you have exactly 24 hours. \" a voice came from beside my house, rushing me and holding me up against my door. it's breathe reeked, the stench of death and smoke. i cried and soiled myself, begging the thing to let me go and leave me alone.  &#x200b;  it snarled at me and ran away, letting me slump to the ground as i continued to cry. i told the police everything i could. they looked skeptical, and they made me consider that i was crazy. especially when an officer came inside and told me there was no graffiti on my shed.  &#x200b;  they told me to call if anything else happened, and then left. i went to my room after ensuring the house was secure and tried to sleep. when the darkness wouldn't consume me, i decided to get up and go back downstairs. coffee and reddit. no shower or binge-watching this time.  &#x200b;  i still couldn't get into my original account, so i settled on my second one. i tried searching for the account of the story that i reported, and nothing came up. i was confused as it had just existed less than a week ago. why would he delete it?  &#x200b;  my phone vibrated and a text popped up. \"less than 14 hours. hurry up. \" i screamed and threw my phone against the wall. i couldn't do this.  &#x200b;  i packed a light bag and left my house. i decided to grab my laptop in case i needed to reach out.  &#x200b;  it's friday now. it hasn't been able to find me since i left. i don't stay in one town for too long. i always wanted to travel, but not under these circumstances. it still sends me messages, now to my email. i can't get rid of my laptop, because i need some way of contacting the outside world beyond hotels and my car.  &#x200b;

polly is heavily invested in her cult so she probably thinks that statutory rape is something normal people of riverdale just wouldn't understand so she needs a cover story. she makes a play for jason, gets him to sleep with her, and convinces him towards the end of his life that he's the father of her babies. jason's a decent sort, so he goes to nana rose to get her ring and approval to marry polly. in reality, jason wasn't the twins' father at all. this could also be one of the reasons why the babies are in some kind of sacrificial whatever in the cult ceremonies-- if their dad is edgar evernever, they could be seen as some kind of magical, powerful children or some other batshit crazy thing.   bottom line: polly's not terribly stable or reliable and still has a ton of mystery around her... not to mention that one way to kill a squicky unintentional incest plot is with some disturbing cult stuff or something else insane instead.

back to my home city after being away for 5 years, and having my long distance relationship gf come to visit me for a planned road trip of western canada, we had rented a car and were prepared for a long day of driving.   but first, i wanted to get a cheap breakfast at the nearest chain known for their good egg, ham,  and cheese, muffin breakfast sandwiches.    so we pull up to the closest franchise to where i live, which is in the not perfect neighborhood of town, but one i've been to 5 years + prior, and park while i get out to get my morning sandwich.  i left my gf who was driving waiting inside the car.  when i get inside i realize that things are not exactly normal.   i could see women who were clearly 'ladies of the evening', and had noticed individuals going from parked car to parked car and thought... ok, hookers and drug dealers, wtf this is weird.    but of course i want my breakfast!  so while in line surrounded by some very colourful individuals i call my gf.  when she answers i just tell her \"lock the doors\".  what i didn't know was that she hadn't kept her phone on her.  she had it in her luggage for the trip.   so when it started to ring, she got out of the car, opened the trunk, opened her suitcase, dug out her phone, and was standing in the parking lot and heard me say \"lock the doors\".      she wanted me to explain, i was surrounded by hookers and drug dealers and didn't want to, it was not a fun time.    i did get my food and when i went to the fountain machine to fill my drink i was doing so beside someone filling a old 2 litre coke bottle

the only time this has happened. the girl next to me was relieved when she got some multiple choice questions completely incorrect and the teacher didn't deduct marks from her; however, he once failed one of my smaller assignments because my writing was messy. i, however, had written my correct answers in a box as neatly as possible because we were never told that neatness of solutions contributed to marks; in addition, we were only performing binary arithmetic.   5. the guy in front of me had nearly nothing, so the teacher promised him a bit more time. he cheated when there were 10 minutes left before the end of class and the teacher stated that it was a bit suspicious, but still gave him a 90.  6. i spent a great deal of time on this subject to appease my teacher, but the students around me are getting higher marks than me even when they make more mistakes than me. it's really frustrating.  grades are genuinely important to me as i want to get an academic award, but i don't

{"text": "hey guys, this might be a little long, but i'm gonna try to keep it as concise as possible. i would really like some outside perspective on this.  so i had planned a nice wine/movie date with my girlfriend last weekend for our 3 month anniversary, (long story short, we met over summer in her state and decided to start a ldr, as i live literally across the country) and it ended up not happening and she still seems very down about it. we both go to university and i was in my hometown with family/friends for thanksgiving. we had not settled on a specific time for the date, and i had told her earlier in the day what i was planning to do for the day which included going out for some drinks with friends who were also home who i hadn't seen in a few months, but i told her that after that we would have our date. everything was okay and i was having a good time with friends, but it started to get a little late my time so i told my friends about the date and that i had to get home. i ended up getting home at \\~11:30pm my time which i did not think was a big issue since it was 8:30pm her time. when i got home, i texted her to no response and tried to facetime her twice, after which i was greeted by a pretty long message explaining how she was disappointed that we had different expectations for what was supposed to be a special night, that she had cancelled plans for this, that she felt like an afterthought through my actions, and that she did not feel excited for it anymore. this, of course, was not my intention at all and i had just figured that it would be an okay time since it was only 8:30 her time and i was pretty confused considering i had also been texting her throughout the night and everything seemed fine until i got home. i apologized and offered to still have the date but she was really upset about this. we texted for a little and agreed that it would be best if we talked about it the next day. i woke up to a text at 5am of her saying she is extremely sad and cannot stop crying, so we picked up the conversation. this is also when i learned that she really wanted the date to also be before midnight my time (which i had not known previously) and that this anniversary really meant a lot to her.   we talked through it a bit that morning, however she seemed to get really depressed and ended up sleeping that entire day, responding to my texts every few hours. it's wednesday and she is still acting very different, i have tried to ask her if she would be open to having a makeup facetime date sometime this week however she keeps saying she needs more time.  this really sucks, i had known that anniversaries are very meaningful to her and had planned a great date, but a small bump turned it all into a disaster and i feel it has really affected us. i tried to tell her that we need to clearly communicate our expectations to each other so something like this doesn't happen again but she tried to explain to me that this is something i should have known and that i should have held this anniversary to the same level of importance as her. granted, i don't think many people view their 3 month anniversary as something of extreme importance but it seems devastating to her that i did not.  did i truly screw up? did she overreact? i really don't know what to think about it and it's starting to affect our relationship and

and once on mediumcore expert difficulty(yes i know im extremely slow and suck at the game but thats beside the point here) and during these two playthroughs ive noticed something:  dying to the moonlord is way too punishing no matter what gamemode you play, whether its softcore or mediumcore (its pretty obvious what the consequences will be in hardcore, that one is on you) you will have to do the entire lunar events again. i found this to be especially true in expert mode where you have to kill even more enemies for the shield to dissappear. as much as i have loved playing the game i feel like this one aspect is a complete failure from a game design perspective. i dont mind having to fight the lunar cultist again because that is a boss with a great design and fun mechanics. i could accept it if you only had to kill a few enemies to shut down the shields after killing the lunar cultist (like 25 in normal mode 40 in expert) but having to kill 150 enemies for each of the four shields just turns it into a boring grind. after all its pretty likely that if you have the skill to beat 25 of the monsters then you probably can also beat 150 or 214235 but why force the player to go through that grind so many times, assuming ideal luck it would still require you to go through this process 9 times. if the dev team feels strongly about the 600 kills for whatever reason they could just have the player only do it once and then after that only have to do 25-40 kills/shield. the whole 150 killcount requirement in itself feels very forced like they wanted to add a few hours of playtime but didnt have any content so they instead decided to artificially increase it by requiring a higher killcount which feels completely off when compared to the entire rest of the game.  to sum it up i propose the following:  reduce the required killcount/pillar for the lunar events, (if nothing else then at least after the first time you complete the events) to a lower amount \\~25-40

the same wall. it's genuinely disheartening. i could best describe it as an ego-backlash, a term i heard before somewhere.  anytime i gain a sliver of progress and of understanding, a touch of inner peace and a faint smell of freedom... a few hours later i get an adverse overreaction by my ego. something bad would happen to me (could be big or small), which is unavoidable in everyday life, that would cause my ego to take over 100%, rendering me unable to see any kind of a 'bigger picture' or detached perspective, making my life a living hell and discouraging me from further practice even.  rinse, repeat, and this is why i only start meditating once every month or so, for the last 6 years.  i'm also acutely aware of thoughts, feelings and sensations in everyday life, i'd describe myself as over-mindful already, right up to the point i actually meditate properly, then proceed to lose my common sense and inner peace for the day. rinse, repeat.  honestly, i might have undiagnosed adhd

https://i.redd.it/n6yl3rwd06121.jpg  so the bumblebee movie is coming out very shortly. and in spite of having covered just about every popular movie franchise in modern hollywood, nando seems to have given *this* one a wide berth. in all his videos, he has only mentioned the transformers live-action films twice; once in his video about big gray villains- where he points to them as the starting point for that specific trend- and then in part 4 of his justice league re-write, to praise alex and roberto for their handling of the final battle in the first movie.   now, i know these films aren't exactly good- but that's why it's so confusing that nando hasn't done a video directly addressing them. after all, they *should* be good. and i think he would be capable of making them good, whether it's with one small change or a full re-write. and they fall within the general superhero/science fiction umbrella that he operates under.  he hasn't said anything that makes me think he'll be addressing the franchise anytime soon. maybe he'll make something about the bumblebee movie after it comes out? i have no idea.  i have a few questions for everyone, though:  1. *should* nando do a video about one of the previous transformers live-action films? 2. if so, which one? 3. should he do one about the bumblebee movie, regardless of how well it turns out? 4. should i post my own ideas

{"text": "hi guys, i have no idea whether this is the place to post. it may be a little too heavy for this thread.   i just moved in with my boyfriend. we have been together for a year but we haven't seen each other much during this time because he goes on work related trips often. moving in together was also an attempt to bring us closer because our schedules are difficult. i'm now about 3 weeks into the new living situation and its beginning to dawn on me that, although i m naturally very cautious, i may not have been cautious enough... i see a lot of good things in him: extreme intelligence & creativity, hilariously funny, very warm, generous and kind-hearted but i m terrified these qualities came with a high price.   he has some type of hoarder problem. the way he is messy is unlike anybodies worst mess ive ever seen. its like his brain doesn't hold on to concepts of orderliness, he doesn't understand that things have a permanent place. i am a very clean person and he knew beforehand that one of my primary conditions to agree to the move was for him to clean up his act. lets just say, i have been doing the most of that work since i've been in the shared flat and one room in the apartment still looks like a trash dump.   furthermore, he has narcolepsia which causes him to have a pretty insane wake up/nighttime routine where he snores like hell during the night to the point where i need to change beds &  he needs to snooze a million times in the morning & eventually has to take ritalin to stay awake for the day. he has had this condition his whole life yet it appears he still hasn't learned how to handle it properly and basically every day is a unique struggle. its also impossible for me to wake him up, he gets like a stubborn toddler and doesn't remember a thing later. i guess its due to his condition and i can't blame him for not being reactive.   but wait, there is more. he doesn't take care of his health. he hasn't seen a dentist in over 3 years. he will frequently have health problems like bad breath, extreme snoring, stomach problems and more but he will never manage to make doctors appointments telling me either that he is scared or that he simply cannot keep appointments and will forget them or doesn't know how to make them (we are in germany, healthcare is free).  he never works out. he doesn't know how to cook. doesn't want to see a therapist. he basically lacks every single skill when it comes to self care & home care. we are both 26. he lied to me about basically every single thing i mentioned here, making it sound way less bad, telling me he'll make appointments, he just has a cold, he forgot, the list goes on. he has lied about things which would have been red flags. now its too late.  he does, however, have a well-paying job which he manages to keep despite the narcolepsia. keeping this job seems to be about the only thing he can manage (miraculously, as he is late a lot). when he comes home he is absolutely exhausted and just passes out mentally.   but what happened today was some next level stuff and its actually the main reason i m posting here. the problems i have described here could be solved practically. i helped him with every single thing and have pushed very hard for him to take care of his body and gave our flat a deep cleanse. i hate doing that as i m not maternal and my attraction to him suffers. i fucking hate it in fact and it overwhelms me as i feel like i have been tricked into a deal i never agreed to. i do however sense his helplessness and if i don't act, we'll drown in trash. yet, i feel solutions are potentially there.  today, however, something else happened which i don't know how to solve. a group of his work colleagues/friends came over to our apartment today and things turned extremely weird very quickly. his friends also know him as a pretty eccentric weirdo and have developed a thick skin but today was different. he told them they needed to hang out in the one messy room in our apartment because he thought i would not want guests in the clean rooms. that is too weird to even wrap my head around.  moreover, when we are in the company of others, he constantly talks in the weirdest ways to me, constantly asking me whether i'm ok and just says the most random things to the point of embarrassing me.   yesterday, i had a private talk to him about him slowly balding and carefully suggested he may cut his hair off some time in the not-too-far-away future. this talk was of utterly private nature and it happened in a loving and a looking-out-for-each-other manner.   when we went out to dinner with his colleagues/friends, he suddenly blurted out \"i'm balding, guys. should i cut my hair off?\"- and everybody went dead silent. i was just staring at him in disbelief. the mild inappropriate affect he displays often, reached peak levels.  he somehow confused our private relationship content with something appropriate to tell a crowd. he has done this multiple times before but never as bad. it makes me scared for the things he tells his colleagues about my private life and the things i don't want people to know.   but the worst thing is, it makes me scared for his mental health as display of inappropriate affect is a very serious indicator of mental illness or personality disorder.  overall, i m super overwhelmed and its all slipping away from me. i was hoping so much that i had finally found somebody who i could be serious with but i m starting to have serious doubts...  \\*\\*tl;dr: just moved in with my boyfriend who lied to me about having his life way more together than it turned out. on top of practical things, i'm now also worried for his mental health. it overwhelms me and i don't know what to do. \\*\\*  &#x200b;  &#x200b;  &#x200b;", "NSFW": "False", "title": "just moved in with my boyfriend - need your help, this is serious!"}, {"text": "i'm always curious about other couples and their

allows it the state of michigan has decided to cut food assistance benefits for the disabled almost in half.  just as a little background, the program in question is called micap.  it is a food assistance program set up to help disabled people who receive ssi purchase food.  you can google micap and read the whole outline, but in short to be eligible for the micap program a person must be disabled and receive ssi (capped at $750 a month), have it as their only source of income, and have little to no assets (be poor).  these cuts are only to the micap program and therefore only affect the disabled.  full disclosure, i am one of these people.  i received the notice my benefits were being cut on thanksgiving.  a copy of the letter i received is here: https://imgur.com/a/kljmhrn  i spoke with my case worker who explained to me that due to these new federal policies benefits for all micap recipients who have housing expenses below $1000 are being reduced.  apparently, this has resulted in hundreds of calls a day.  to put this in perspective, before the cut a recipient would have received $171 a month.  which means they needed to feed themselves and often their family on approximately $5.70 a day.  after the cut, the same person will now receive $100 a month.  meaning now they must do so on approximately $3.33 a day.  so, for much less than the average person will spend at starbucks a disabled person must now feed themselves all day.  this is made worse by the fact many disabled people have special diets they must adhere to.    myself included.  as a kidney failure patient i can't simply eat the cheapest thing.  ramen, peanut butter, even potatoes could actually kill me.  most of the foods we think of as \"cheap poor people foods\" are not allowed on my diet.  in this i'm not alone.  if you or someone you know is affected by this or you simply want to help please take a moment to reach out to your representatives and senators.  tell them taking the little benefits the disabled receive away is a cruel thing to do to the most vulnerable among us.    the old, the sick, and the injured have suffered enough without being forced to go hungry, too.

called nepal, located right between india and china. some notable things people might know nepal for are that it's the only national with a non-rectangular flag, it has a large majority of the world's largest mountains, including mt. everest, and buddha was born there. i lived in nepal until i was 8, which was when my family and i moved to america.  it's been 14 years since i've come to the us, but i still distinctly remember the day i left. i remember saying goodbye to all of my friends, uncles, aunts, and grandparents. i remember getting sick on the plane and puking. i remember crying. everything else is a haze, but i don't think i could ever forget that day. thinking back, it was definitely much more difficult for my parents to leave than me. i was an only child, and left to go to another country with my mother and father. learning a different culture would just come naturally to me as i grew up. that's the advantage of youth. my parents, on the other hand, had spent several decades in nepal. they grew up, went to school, found jobs and got married, all in a different land. they had brothers and sisters, unlike me, whom they had to leave behind. they left behind their entire family and lives, largely so i could get a better opportunity at an education.   i won't lie, it was extremely difficult to start school in america. i started in the middle of the year, had no friends, and could barely speak the language. soon, i met a couple of other nepali people that would become some of the best friends in my life. i didn't know much about the country, so sometimes they made me do stupid things, and i would gladly do them. why wouldn't i? if i could make friends that way, i didn't think about it, not even for a second. but i came to learn that they were good people. one kid from my school who was my neighbor once made fun of me because every time i said the word \"tree\", it sounded like the word \"three\". they saw this, and defended me. i can't quite remember what they said, but i remember smiling about it.  time passed, and eventually, things got easier. i learned english at a pretty fast rate and was released from the english second language program. middle school and high school was extremely simple, in the sense that i didn't have to put in any effort to do well. my strengths were the sciences and mathematics, such as chemistry, calculus and physics. my weaknesses were classes which required analysis of literature and the arts, such as history and english. once i learned enough english to be able to speak and write at a normal student's level, i did not try to get better at it.   eventually, it was my senior year at high school and i had to decide where to go. where did i want to spend the next 4 years of my life? people around my often talked about \"dream colleges\", the ones they were hoping to get into. i did not have anything like that. my thought process to choosing a college was \"where can i get the best education for a decent price?\". in connecticut, it had to be uconn. i didn't need any fancy private college to fulfill my dreams. after all, it's not where you get your education that's important, it's what you decide to do with it. my dream was and is simple, solve problems. use what i learned to solve the problems in people's lives. and i believed that i could do that with a degree from uconn.  college went by in a flash. i met all sorts of people, some whom inspired me to become a better person, and others whom i would try to avoid, like the plague. but at the end of the day, there's not a single thing i regret. maybe i should have studied a little bit more for that exam, maybe i should have gone to that class more often, but those are things everyone experiences.   and that is my story. i am really, really lucky. yes, it was difficult socially and financially when my family and i just arrived in the us. i remember living in a extremely small apartment, where there was only one room and the room wasn't even big enough to fit a bed. my parents and i slept in the living room. yes, i missed everyone i knew back in nepal. i remember crying at a simple thought of the people i knew from there. but, i had the chance to study whatever i wanted and to be whomever i wanted. unfortunately, a large majority of the world does not get that opportunity. the life i have right now was made possible through the hard work, love and tears of my parents. i will never forget that, and i hope to continue growing as a person, professionally and personally.  that's the end, for now. hopefully, this didn't come off as conceited. i don't think i'm an amazing person with an amazing life. as the title says, i think i'm a simple guy who's led a simple life. and i'm proud of that. because at the

 the game adds a few extra layers of malicious bullshit when you play as the high elves. your island is huge and divided by mountains in such a way that it's impossible to defend evenly with decent-quality armies. and you can't confederate some of your neighbors, for no apparent reason, which means they'll instantly colonize any new ruins, right under the nose of the stack that got dropped on your weakest city.   there's a difference between difficulty and fairness, and the way they've implemented ritual armies really raises the bar for unfair systems that feel like the game is cheating. i just had to get on here and rage about it because each ritual turns the game into an obnoxious chore and sucks the fun out of my campaign. chaos fullstacks are great; teleporting them through my defenses is horse shit.", "NSFW": "False", "title": "whoever designed ritual army spawns needs to spend just a day or two in hell."}, {"text": "[lindsey graham threatens to withhold vote on spending bill until hearing from cia on khashoggi death](https://reddit.com//r/news/comments/a1ca5z)  [go1dfish undelete link](http://r.go1dfish.me/r/news/comments/a1ca5z)  [unreddit undelete link](https://unreddit.com/r/news/comments/a1ca5z)  author: /u/axette", "NSFW": "False", "title": "11-29 00:53 - 'lindsey graham threatens to withhold vote on spending bill until hearing from cia on khashoggi death' (cbsnews.com) by /u/axette removed from /r/news within 2-12min - reason: politics"}, {"text": "on a re-read i noticed a small thing that i thought ide share  patrick is famous for his attention to detail, and especially when it comes to names, denna and kvothe land on the name ash for denna's patron. it seems just luck but that itsnt really how pat works. my theory comes from skarpis story when its mentioned that first to join tehlu infront of selitos is a man named kirel \" who had been burnt and left in the ash of myr tariniel\" just a thought but its one of the only times i see ash mentioned, random but thought ide share", "NSFW": "False", "title": "theory on denna's patron"}, {"text": "disgusted and frustrated. even my most sulky, add-riddled kids can bring it down with a gentle reminder. i asked this woman three times to lower her voice over the phone and she continued to shout and carry on about things she'd been given plenty of notice about.  she's coming in tomorrow to meet with me and my principal, who's very supportive of me, but ugh. i'm not getting paid to be your case manager, lady.", "NSFW": "False", "title": "had my first parent yell at me over the phone"}, {"text": "they seem complete opposites in concept, and both require energy to occur (say fusion for example, lots of energy put into the system to force nuclei together)... and somehow both result in massive release of energy.  part of my problem understanding this is that i want to think in terms of chemistry, so that a reaction in one direction (like fission) might be analogous to something like an endo- or exothermic reaction, i must be wrong in this line of thinking though. how does this all work?", "NSFW": "False", "title": "eli5: how is it that both fission and fusion can release enormous amounts of energy?"}, {"text": "[https://imgur.com/a/kqghru0](https://imgur.com/a/kqghru0)", "NSFW": "False", "title": "[fs] my account $40"}, {"text": "here is the [**amazon sales rank chart**](https://bestreviewprof.com/black-friday-deals-sales-ads-2018-amazon/).  i discovered this page on google. it is absolutely best option to find the deals, sales, coupons and ads. you can find instant daily deals and promo codes. this page might be really useful if you want to find great online deals. there are hundreds of offers from different stores.  the complete link: [https://bestreviewprof.com/black-friday-deals-sales-ads-2018-amazon/](https://bestreviewprof.com/black-friday-deals-sales-ads-2018-amazon/)", "NSFW": "False", "title": "amazon sales rank chart"}, {"text": "&#x200b;  https://i.redd.it/ze7ox9py36121.png  ipa download link:  pokego++ r97 : [http://www.mediafire.com/file/jr3b6qwp3atjp09/r97\\ newfixed.ipa/file](http://www.mediafire.com/file/jr3b6qwp3atjp09/r97 newfixed.ipa/file)  poke2++ go   : [http://www.mediafire.com/file/ahaan0bwdwfkdxp/poke2\\ r97.ipa/file](http://www.mediafire.com/file/ahaan0bwdwfkdxp/poke2 r97.ipa/file)  ispoofer go  : waiting for the official website to update...  &#x200b;  use impactor 0.9.51 install.  don't need to open the airplane mode to play directly  &#x200b;  poke2++ go & ispoofer go can be use 2 or 3 open, they has been separated.  &#x200b;", "NSFW": "False", "title": "pokego++ r97(0.129.1) & ispoofer(0.129.1a) fixed free"}, {"text": "&#x200b;  [dio](https://i.redd.it/mbsr0ei646121.jpg)", "NSFW": "False", "title": "no one can just deflect my emerald splash!"}, {"text": "i wanna fuckin bench go away", "NSFW": "False", "title": "one person using two squat/bench racks?

than when i started. i still struggle with hitting the balls into the pockets, i do not know spin or english, i do not set up the next shot, i can't draw, anything. i play multiple games by myself a day, i have read a few books on pool, i have played against friends and family yet i am at a very beginner level and honestly believe i have gotten worse.  &#x200b;  close to 2 years ago i started to go magic and cardistry. since then although i practice pretty much every day i have not gotten any better. i can still only do the most basic of magic tricks that do not require any sleight of hand just self-working tricks and for cardistry, i only know beginner moves and there is a lot of \"beginner\" moves that are well out of my reach.  &#x200b;  i have played a game called league of legends for 5 years now and i am still stuck in gold iv. i have had a coach, played countless games, mained a champion for close to two years and i am still below average and can feel myself getting worse.

 i tried a butterfly knife for a few months and quit because i could never learn anything harder than the most basic things.  &#x200b;  i quit baseball after 7 years because at the beginning i was the best, but every year everyone got better and i stayed the same so i fell behind.  &#x200b;  i played basketball every day for 9 months two years in a row and i am honest to god terrible and make possibly 20% of my shots.  &#x200b;  the list goes on and i am sure you get the point by now. i am super dedicated to the things i put my mind to, but honestly, i am super unmotivated because i feel

remembering the way you smiled at me and waved, and i'm just in love with your smile and the way it lights up your whole face. conversation flows so easily between us, and i wish we were able to see each other more and hang out. you're so handsome, but you're also so friendly and kind, which makes me like you even more. it was really cold and windy today and your teeth were chattering, and you don't know how badly i just wanted to reach over and give you a hug so you wouldn't be so cold.   it started last year at the dining hall when i was just getting dinner on a random night in september and i saw you out of the corner of my eye. i froze momentarily and then managed to subtly look at you from afar, and i was in awe at how attractive you were. i just continued on with my life and saw you here and there around campus, and i never thought you would notice me, let alone talk to me. i'm really not sure, but one time i could have sworn i overheard your friend telling you to just talk to me. i was standing right next to you waiting for my food, playing it cool, and your friend was encouraging you, saying this was your chance to finally talk to me. i had my headphones in at the time and i was pretending i couldn't hear anything. i could be wrong but at that time i was pretty sure that you liked me back.   as time went on last year, i became friends with some people in your friend group. i would sometimes run into them at the dining hall and sit at the same table as all of you, and you and i didn't get to talk much but it was nice to be able to hang out with you and your friends. we even added each other on social media; i never thought i would even make it that far.  fast forward to this year. you moved to the apartments on campus, so i don't really get to see you much at the dining hall or just around school. we don't have any classes together and we pretty much live on opposite sides of our school - it's a small campus but i've only run into you a few times this semester. at the very beginning of this semester, i was walking in the hall and you were coming up the stairs and you said hi to me - i was talking on the phone at the time but i ran into you sitting alone at a table a few minutes later. i'm a pretty shy person but i just wanted to talk to you so badly so i just went up to you and started a conversation. we talked for about twenty minutes and had a really great conversation until you had to leave, and i've rarely seen you since then.  we have been liking each other's social media posts, and you wished me a happy birthday on facebook which was really sweet. i think we're both pretty shy and we just don't see each other much, but i really really like you. i've liked you for way too long. seeing you today just brought back a rush of feelings that i've tried to suppress so i could forget about you because i was convinced that nothing would happen between us. i succeeded to not think about you for a bit, but now i just can't stop thinking about that smile of yours and the sound of your voice after seeing you today.   i feel like we're running out of time. i only have a year and a half left until i graduate, and i would just love to be able to get closer to you and for us to see each other and hang out more. i don't usually initiate anything if i like a guy, but i'm super tempted to just reach out to you somehow and try to get closer to you. i think we'd get along really well and make a great match. even with the limited amount of time i've spent with you i've enjoyed those moments so much and they make me fall for you all over again. i've been daydreaming about you all day, and it would be amazing and i'd be so grateful if these daydreams became a reality.   hoping for the best <3", "NSFW": "False", "title":

that would be cool    and would synergize well with the idea.  &#x200b;  &#x200b;  2- rework turrets. if 1 player only gets ahead with the rest getting smashed, he should have the right to stall out the game more for his 0/7 bot lane to scale, so why not make it possible to reconstruct the turret for maybe 3-4000 gold? that is reasonable in my opinion, or having a 2 secs turret invincibility for 1000 gold maybe (random numbers popping out of my head, you can change them if they're too op)  &#x200b;  &#x200b;  3- this is crazy, but it's good. at the 30ish minute, take out the minimap, and introduce voice comms riot, come on.   what team game doesn't have voice comms in 2018, once you take a step on the summoner's rift, you're in war, and communication is the key to winning wars. removing the minimap forces team members to talk to each other, move together and take objectives to get the hell out of this war as victors.  &#x200b;  &#x200b;  4- clan wars, yes you guessed it. ever thought about how useless clans are on league. the only thing you do is group ranting, chatting or looking for new friends, well guess what, discord does a better job at that. riot, introduce clan wars, so that being part of a clan makes you connected with its members. or just think of something that will change the clans' situation.  &#x200b;  &#x200b;  5- ok this one isn't very original but riot... battle royale when?

system if you ask me anyways   iv'e never written a review so ill try my best  &#x200b;  overall i give this  7/10 the installation is alot longer and requires alot more to purchase then most exhaust system but it changed the complete rear end of the bike meanwhile it shoots mini flames and spits and also sounds like a small gun at times this exhaust just sounds so meaty and throaty its not funny how nice it sounds :)     tips and hints   get a fuel commander program thingy it will save you alot of fuel i went from 240km's on a single fuel tank to 150km's so adjusting and getting one of them fuel program things are a must     if you worryed about the sound and if its legal i suggest getting it checked out i paid a mechainc $20 for proof it is under the legal limit   &#x200b;  if you want a loud and attention exhaust system i think this or the iixl would be the best choice but i have never heard the iixl before           sound/road reputation  7/10 i give it 8 and a half out of /10 but in australia im worried ill get pulled over one day from the exhaust system     well the sound on this exhaust wow where do i start when i first went from stock to toce my mouth dropped with amaze from the deep throaty sound coming for a 1 pstion 125cc stock engine i grew up with big bbikes alla orund me roaring and never standard after we first fired it up my father's mouth driopped aswell and i rember him having the biggest grin on his face i mean this exhaust is throaty and if you like me and you have a standard grom expect your fuel to go down the drain more on that after     anyways so since my father done more of the work i let him ride it first and this was at night time but i swear i could hear the toce system km's away orginally my bike you coudln't hear it after maybe 10 house i dunno i don't remember but now ohh my god you can hear it km's away he took off down the big straight and went around the block and i could still hear it faintly but still could and to make it even cooler. since i have a stock grom it running rich and this can be fixed from quite a few methods but still my stock anyways since it running rich when ever you back off the throttle the toce littler y spit's and shoot small see able flames at night it is so awesome  p.s. i would not riden this without baffles always use them it is down right to loud and distorting if you do not use the baffles we tried  also this system is light a really light system if you want the grom to weight less this is a good option  also riding with this exuast is fun and loud but on long trips 50+km's i feel like it gives me a headache haha     road reputation   this is where it gets interesting i get scared that one day im going to get pulled over police but it been 8 months and nothing has happend yet (touch wood) but that only is only in my city not the big city's   let ke put it this way when i ride in first gear and im at 7rpm i see some people put thier fingers in thier ears because its loud 97.1 db's (sa legal limit is 94db's) and also i had my grom in a show and shine and it got alot of looks i also even got 3 complaints because they reconised who i was due to the bike and wanted to tell me to take the exhaust off    i have currently wrapped my toce in steel wool to make it quieter and it is now 93.7db's (under the limit just!!!) :)  you will also get alot of people to tell you to rev your

 \\[ehp and damage multiplier\\]([https://imgur.com/1spdmrt](https://imgur.com/1spdmrt))  &#x200b;  \\[ehp and damage multiplier vs pre 7.20\\]([https://imgur.com/2shndku](https://imgur.com/2shndku))  &#x200b;  \\[how changing armor value changes ehp\\]([https://imgur.com/gwclwdj](https://imgur.com/gwclwdj))  &#x200b;  \\[how changing armor value changes ehp pre 7.20\\]([https://imgur.com/ehzeqg2](https://imgur.com/ehzeqg2))  &#x200b;  tl;dr armor is more valuable than before, and unlike before, armor increases in value slightly the more you have. for example, at 1 armor point, each new armor point gives you \\~ 6% of your max health as ehp (used to be 5%). at 40 armor, each new point is giving you \\~ 8.5%. this makes armor reduction more valuable than before, especially against high armor targets. however, negative armor values behaves basically the same as it was before. stacking negative armor still results in massive diminishing returns, and ones ehp with negative armor is very similar.  &#x200b;  \\#the armor formula  the \\*armor formula\\* presented by valve gives physical resistance. resistance is the percentage of incoming damage that is blocked. the new armor formula is the following:  &#x200b;  physical resistance = ( 0.052 \\* current\\ armor ) / ( 0.9 + 0.048 \\* |current\\ armor|))  &#x200b;  the patch notes provided by valve failed to include the absolute value bars (a typo that has lead to some of the bad information floating around i think), but i have confirmed that this is the correct formula for physical resistance.  &#x200b;  a useful way of thinking about this is in terms of the \\*damage multiplier\\*, which i will call dm.  incoming physical damage is scaled by the dm before subtracting from your hp. this is essentially the damage that is left over after resistance blocks some, so we simply subtract the \\*armor formula\\* from 1 to get the dm  &#x200b;  dm = 1 - ( 0.052 \\* current\\ armor ) / ( 0.9 + 0.048 \\* |current\\ armor|))  &#x200b;  while similar to the previous formula  &#x200b;  pre 7.20 dm = 1 - ( 0.05 \\* current\\ armor ) / ( 1 + 0.05 \\* |current\\ armor|))  &#x200b;  the new formula behaves very differently asymptotically. so theoretically, now if you were able to achieve 225 armor points, that would give you 100% physical resistance (damage multiplier would be 0), and if you were able to increase your armor further you would approach physical resistance of 108.33%, so i suppose physical attacks would heal for 8.33% of the attack damage? if someone can test this in some way, that would be pretty cool.  &#x200b;  despite the asymptotic difference, the actual values produced by these formulae look very similar for normal armor values. however, we can really see a difference when looking at effective hp %.   &#x200b;  \\#ehp  &#x200b;  another way of looking at all this is the idea of effective hp, or ehp. ehp is the amount of physical damage it takes to kill you. you can calculate ehp by scaling ones current hit-points by the reciprocal of the dm. to verify this, just imagine you have your dm is 0.5. incoming damage is halved before reaching your hit-points, so they have to effectively deal 2x your hit-points in damage to kill you. thus, ones hit-points are scaled by the reciprocal of the dm. this number i am calling the ehp%. after some algebra, the formula for this number actually looks pretty different if armor is positive or negative. for now let's just consider positive armor values.  &#x200b;  ehp% (armor>0) = (0.9 + 0.048 \\* armor)/(0.9 - 0.004 \\* armor)  &#x200b;  this is very different from the pre-7.20 ehp% formula which looked like  &#x200b;  pre 7.20 ehp% (armor>0) = 1 + 0.05 \\* armor  &#x200b;  thus it used to be that adding more armor added a fixed amount of ehp. namely, adding a point of armor would increase your ehp by 5% of your actual health pool. post 7.20, however, the amount of ehp gained actually \\*increases\\* if you already have more armor! this leads us to want to look at the derivative of the ehp% function. the derivative (or slope) tells us essentially how much ehp we gain by adding a single armor point. it used to be a fixed value of 0.05, or 5%. now it is  &#x200b;  ehp% slope (armor>0) = 0.0468/(0.9 - 0.004 .\\*(armor))\\^2  &#x200b;  this starts at \\~0.06 for 0 armor, and increases as one accumulates more armor. to see all this graphically look here: \\[ehp and damage multiplier vs pre 7.20\\]([https://imgur.com/2shndku](https://imgur.com/2shndku))  &#x200b;  in conclusion, armor is more valuable than it used to be, and increases in value the more armor you have (slightly).  &#x200b;  \\#value of armor reduction  the changes affect the value of armor manipulation as well, naturally. to study this, we can look at the ratio of ehp before armor change is applied to their ehp after the change. we can call this number the \\*ehp multiplier\\*. it is a function of current armor, and the armor change we are applying to the target. graphically: \\[ehp multiplier\\]([https://imgur.com/gwclwdj](https://imgur.com/gwclwdj)).  from this figure, for example, we see that applying -19 armor (desolator + solar crest) to someone with 40 armor reduces their ehp to \\~58% of what it used to be. pre 7.20 it was more like \\~67%, as can be seen from this figure: \\[ehp multiplier pre 7.20\\]([https://imgur.com/ehzeqg2](https://imgur.com/ehzeqg2)). thus, especially against high armor targets, armor reduction is more valuable than pre 7.20.", "NSFW": "False", "title": "armor in 7.20: analysis of the changes (with pretty pictures)."}, {"text": "hi i'm incapable of finding this sht myself. i tried googling but i couldn't find anything. does anyone have and links to information regarding ranked modes? are \"expert\" modes basically the competitive modes? does valve expect us to pay a premium ticket every time we want to play in a competitive setting?", "NSFW": "False", "title": "info on competitive or ranked modes?"}, {"text": "hey! i'm new here. hope this post is formatted ok. i'm looking for diet repair because almost everyday, around two hours after lunch, i get hit with the bloat. a nasty, nasty bloat feels like there is a fucking basketball in my belly. it makes it very difficult to concentrate. the only thing i've found that helps a little is having a glass of kombucha, which is getting expensive. here is a sample of my diet. most days are very similar to this. keep in mind i am vegetarian cresting on full-vegan. this is a more high-calorie day. male, 6', 170  **breakfast:**  >small glass of kombucha   3 cups coffee with coconut oil   2 packets quia brand oatmeal   bowl of watermelon/pineapple   2-4 vegan sausage links (soy based)   orgain protine shake (w/ soy milk)  **snack:**  >banana   a few handfulls of mixed nuts   blueberry lara bar     **lunch:**  >some kind of mixed veggie  (peppers, broccoli, sweet potatoe) /brown rice/chick pea, vegan protein thing. could be tofu, tempheh, seitan etc.  or 2 pieces peanut butter toast (ezeikle bread) with banana or misc. vegan soup w/ brown rice. mized fruit (grapes, kiwi, orange)  **snack:**  >red delicious apple, kiki, few handfulls of nuts, orgain protine shake w/ water. apple pie lara bar   **dinner:**  >some kind of mixed veggie (peppers, broccoli, sweet potatoe) /brown rice/chick pea, vegan protein thing. could be tofu, tempheh, seitan etc or two beond meat patties w/ sour kraut and mustard on whole wheat bun. or 2 amy's kitchen bean and rice burritos.  so that's a pretty average day. fluctuations might include suhi or burrio for either dinner or lunch or the addition of a mega shake (soy milk, oats, banana, straw berries, mct oil).   i've tired isolating foods but i can't pin down whats making me feel so terrible in the afternoons. there's often a strained bm accompanying the bloat.

(he hasn't been about to have a serious relationship for 1.5 years).  he requested to go back to being friends for the time being and said \"we might not ever be right together and i need to know that you can handle just being friends. otherwise there will always be an expectation and it will stress us both out\".  &#x200b;  so back to being friends. i still see him weekly because we have the same tight knit friend group. i still feel a spark and it's hard to be around him.", "NSFW": "False", "title": "me (30f) close friend (29m) - began seeing my close friend romantically after he initiated it and now he is backing out."}, {"text": "tldr at the bottom.  let me begin by stating that i love women. i have yet to find any drug that can have the same exponentially amplifying effect on my mood as female energy. over the short period that i've experienced success with women, it has become clear to me that there's just nothing else out there that can take my mood/self-esteem/happiness from an already good place, and turbocharge them. it's intoxicating. if you read to the end, you'll find that i actually make the case that this problem is in large part made worse by low-self-esteem men.  that being said, there are a few things i've noticed in the same time period mentioned above, that seem to me to be to apply to more women than i'd like. every demographic group has a small subset of assholes, but in my experience the sense of entitlement that the title of this post mentions is rather pervasive.   anyone who has been active and engaged in nightlife for an extended period of time knows exactly where i'm going with this. the evidence of this sexual entitlement is a soaked shirt and an ice cube making its way down my chest, the (actually mind blowing) number of times i've been called gay or a fa\\*\\*\\*\\* by a woman i rebuffed after meeting her only five minutes before, and the number of times some woman who thinks she's hot shit has walked up to me and a woman *i was actually there* with a devilish look in her eyes that says: \"i think i'm god's gift to men and i'm going to steal this guy from his girlfriend.\" i have even witnessed male friends have to bring their girlfriends over to explain to bouncers who are trying to kick them out that the woman who just told them that her boyfriend touched her inappropriately is just some juvenile asshole whose advances he rebuffed.  &#x200b;  now, in the last week i have seen the following threads pop up in (these threads are basically a monthly occurrence):  ask men - what was the most obvious signal you missed from a woman?  ask women - what was the most obvious signal you sent a guy that he missed?  dating advice - ladies, what are the most painfully obvious signals men missed from you?  only one of these threads should exist (ask men) without an explicit caveat that the only way for the people being asked to know if they should even be answering the question is if they have somehow received confirmation from the guy in question that he truly missed her signals. this confirmation could be either:  \\- they had sex with them at a later time, and when asked why he wasn't down sooner, the man expressed that he was oblivious to the woman's interest.  \\- the man stated directly that he would have had sex with the woman if he had known she was sending him signals.   if you're a woman whose advances were shrugged off with an air of obtuseness, and you never received any later confirmation that this obtuseness was legitimate, you most likely experienced something called: \"being let down easy.\" these days, that is *exactly* how i would behave in a situation where i felt a woman coming onto me and for whatever reason, i wasn't interested. **my, and other mens' behaving that way has been incentivized by a seemingly large group of women who require men to give them the out of \"i wasn't interested anyway\" (plausible deniability), lest he'd like to be berated and called a fa\\*\\*\\*\\* in the middle of a nightclub, have his reputation sullied in his social circle, or worse. being direct, is frankly just too risky.**  &#x200b;  who are these women? they're the female version of what you see in r/niceguys. they are civil right up to the point they can't get what they want out of you, and then suddenly, you're a fa\\*\\*\\*\\*. the most interesting question is: why do they behave this way? my somewhat educated theory is the title of this post, but there's more. men with low self-esteem incentivize this behavior too. let's go back into the anatomy of one of the situations i mentioned at a nightclub. a woman has just been rebuffed by a guy who was either there with someone else, or simply wasn't interested, and responded by calling him some nasty name. what does she do now? she struts over to the bar, tells some sad looking guy her woes, and he responds with something along the lines of:   \"you're beautiful, nobody should reject *you*! *i* would never do that! here, let me buy you a drink.\"  this guy is also a massive part of the problem. this is the guy who is convinced that small scall white-knightery is going to get him laid. **the truth is that this woman is never going to have any interest in him, she is there simply to have some poor sap pump her self-esteem so that she can feel good enough about herself to get back out on the dance floor and pursue a bigger fish.**  i will be the first to admit that sometimes men *do* miss obvious signals, and that it's very likely they're doing it more often than women are. however, the overall occurrence of this is overstated, and seems to me at least to be a part of a larger trend where any natural difference along gender lines is only true if it somehow paints men as less than.  tldr: many women feel entitled to sex from any man they come onto, and protect their egos by insisting that men are just social oafs when in reality they are often just being let down easy. this entitlement is buoyed up by men with low self-esteem who allow themselves to be validation faucets for women.", "NSFW": "False", "title": "the common belief that most men are out there missing obvious signals of sexual interest from women is generated, in large part, by the fact that many women feel so entitled to sex from any man they show interest in that admitting they were being let down easy would crush their fragile egos."}, {"text": "https://imgur.com/a/vgexzra", "NSFW": "False", "title": "camp roofs make this game literally unplayable"}, {"text": "a teacher read this to me in 5th grade so roughly 1997 or so. its a kids chapter book and the only major bit i remember is the kids siblings drew on their baby with a magic marker and either tried to sell it or sold views of ghe tatooed baby.", "NSFW": "False", "title": "kids chapter book"}, {"text": "my pick is probably king booker", "NSFW": "False", "title": "who was the best king of the ring winner ever?"}, {"text": "can't find a good place to watch it and netflix only has 12 episodes of it", "NSFW": "False", "title": "where to watch the complete season 2 in hd?"}, {"text": "it works sometimes, but not all the time. what comes through are calls and that is the worst because i don't want to be disturbed.  any thoughts?", "NSFW": "False", "title": "do not disturb mode does not work on my phone - why?"}, {"text": "omegleguy254", "NSFW": "True", "title": "24 hairy uncut otter showering after the gym"}, {"text": "##general information  **time**     |**media**                            |**location**        |**misc** :------------|:------------------------------------|:-------------------|:------------------------- 09:59 pm eastern |**game preview**: [nba.com](http://www.nba.com/games/20181128/orlpor#/preview) | moda center               |  08:59 pm central |**game matchup**: [nba.com](http://www.nba.com/games/20181128/orlpor#/matchup) | **team subreddits**| 07:59 pm mountain|**play by play**: [nba.com](http://www.nba.com/games/20181128/orlpor#/pbp)| /r/orlandomagic          | 06:59 pm pacific |**box score**: [nba.com](http://www.nba.com/games/20181128/orlpor#/boxscore) | /r/ripcity          |  -----  [reddit stream](https://reddit-stream.com/comments/auto) (you must click this link from the comment page.)", "NSFW": "False", "title": "game thread: orlando magic (10-11) @ portland trail blazers (12-8) - (november 28, 2018)"}, {"text": "\"i was looking at an old photo and i can't believe i let myself leave the house looking like that!\"  this is a real sentiment (but paraphrased) that i've read on here repeatedly. i'm completely cognizant that it's not being said maliciously, congratulations on the progress and all, but... ow.  as someone who started with around 150lbs to lose to make medical people satisfied that i have achieved a magical (and scientifically questionable) number, reading comments like that, even when spoken about the author's own self, are unbelievably demoralizing instead of reaffirming or inspiring.  to be reminded that even if i make my doctor happy, i'll only ever be a few pounds away from being so revolting that someone thinks i shouldn't allow myself to leave the house is enough to make me cry. my goal bmi is the starting point for other people, for fucks sake. and i do this all knowing that i will probably have wobbly skin for the rest of my life even if i hit that magical number... even if i spend weeks worth of hours tracking every calorie i eat. even if i keep spending more money than i otherwise would on food because protein isn't as cheap as carbs. even if i replace my wardrobe several times over... am i supposed to feel ok with letting myself leave the house looking like *that*?

 doubtful, but possible.  if that was it, then things were more dire than i'd originally anticipated.  i could also see the status of all the slayers -- mine was still in for repairs, and lia's was still listed as salvage.  i wasn't sure if they were going to rebuild it or just construct a new one.  i'd need more data.  it also appeared that there were conventional military forces here, too.  drones, ground-based mobile weapons platforms, transports (including for slayers), and even vtol aircraft.  it sounded like they wouldn't be worth much against outsiders, but i wanted to know why.  it was annoying that i didn't have any good information about the magitech that they used.  i was guessing that the so-called nanomachines (more likely nanotools and micromachines) acted as programmable matter, changing properties by how they were assembled via the arcane elements, but i wasn't going to make any assumptions yet.  each life seemed to expose me to different kinds of magitech, so it was hard to say anything for sure.  the local bbs was a chaotic mess that i'd have to devote more time to working through.  why did it seem that every universe had to make things shiny with more options that only bogged things down instead of focusing on core functionalities and user friendliness?  i was disturbed from my work by a knock on the door.  i fought for the words before i called out.  \"wait!\"  i'd washed my clothes in the shower, then hung them in front of the air exchange.  i was now pleased to find that it had worked, mostly.  my shirt and underwear were dry, but my pants and socks were still wet.  no matter.  i donned everything but the socks and shoes before opening the door.  hanna frowned, looking me up and down.  \"still wearing that?\"  \"yes.\"  \"i thought i told you yesterday to order some clothes?\"  i offered a half-hearted shrug.  \"docked pay.\"  she groaned at that.  \"you know what?  i'm going to rage about it later.  for now, though, get your shoes on.  we're going to the commons room.\"  i glanced at my socks in front of the vent, then looked back at her.  \"'m fine.\"  hanna looked down at my feet, then back up to me before sighing.  \"you're impossible.\"  \"yes.\"  impossible was an apt word for me.  \"fine.  if you fuck up your feet, it's your problem and not mine.  come on.\"  thankfully, the commons weren't far from my housing unit.  there seemed to be a special ward just for resonators, and while there wasn't anything to keep the rest of the staff of the redoubt and the workers for the proto-dome out, they didn't seem to move into the resonator housing block for some reason.  probably local societal norms.  i was once again greeted with the commons.  a large room, capable of housing over 30 people while still letting them have their own cliques.  a small bar, a few video games, your standard jukebox with kareoke setup, television, plenty of tables, chairs, and couches arranged in such a way that people could be social or keep to themselves, dartboard...  the lighting looked like it had been ripped out and redone to provide well lit areas as well as softer areas, giving it a strangely homey feel.  the rugs helped with that.  there weren't many people here, though.  \"this is where we hang out between missions and all that,\" hanna said.  \"part of orientation is introducing you to everyone.  a lotta times, people will just throw you in and make the rounds to everyone at once.  that's a bit overwhelming, so fuck that.  four's good enough for one time, yeah?\"  \"yeah,\" i agreed.  if you overwhelmed someone with too many faces at once, they tended not to stick.  a handful at a time was better.  hanna led me to one wild-haired woman with an eyepatch who was sharpening a knife.  \"oi, amah.  this is edin.  he don't look like much, but he's a good guy.\"  amah looked up at me with a critical eye.  wait, did her outfit have a boob window?  what the fuck?  \"edin, this here's amah.  rough and tumble type, but a good one to patrol with.\"  amah stuck out her hand.  \"how're you adjusting?\"  it took me a moment to take her hand.  after another moment, i shrugged as an answer to her question.  \"yeah, you aren't the talking type, are you?\"  hanna snorted.  \"he's pretty laconic, but don't depend on that.  he'll surprise you sometimes.\"  \"that so?\"  amah looked up at me again, grinning a bit.  \"still, looks like this isn't phasing you too much.  a lotta newbies piss and moan about how unfair this is, being transported from some cushy life into a war, but you know what?  it ain't all that bad.  \"you know who the enemy is on sight, and the outsiders don't lay down mines that kill you a year later or try and use chemical warfare or whatever.  a goddamn plus in my book.\"  hanna smirked a bit.  \"amah comes from a pre-information age world that's a war-torn hellhole on par with ours.\"  \"except mine only had other humans to deal with.\"  amah gave me a lopsided grin.  \"listen, i'm pretty easy to get along with.  don't make me carry your ass, kill the ugly things, and maybe bring me some sweets on occasion, and we're good.  if you really wanna get on my good side, you can bring me--\"  \"don't listen to her,\" hanna interrupted.  \"your lung fully grown yet?\"  amah's face fell into a glare.  \"*no.*  but it ain't slowing me down, and i got all my fingers back.\"  hanna turned to me.  \"she's got a thing about making explosives.\"  \"what's so fucking bad about that?  i've been making them since i could walk.  it's relaxing!\"  i nodded once.  \"respect.\"  sometimes, the familiar made stressful situations easier.  a touch of home in a foreign world.  \"see, he gets it!  figured you would.  folks don't hop in their slayer their first day and kick ass without plenty of experience backing them up.  you'll do fine here, newbie.\"  with that, amah seemed to switch off, going back to sharpening her knife.  words done, she just wanted to relax while her lung... regrew?  was that why she wore an eyepatch?  no, hanna would have mentioned the obvious instead of the lung that she probably damaged in an explosives mishap.  which meant that the eyepatch had nothing to do with it.  initial guess?  amah lost it years before she was pulled here, her brain rewired itself to compensate, and the nanites couldn't fix the eye without mucking up her brain considerably.  at least, that was my initial guess.  i needed to understand resonance more.  stupid universes using different words for the same thing led to confusion.  hanna, though, was already heading towards a man writing in a large book at a table.  his ornate robes already gave me an idea as to what i was going to look into.  \"hey, pete.  look alive.\"  'pete' looked up from his work, immediately fixing me with a serene smile.  \"ah, what is this before me?  a new warrior for our divine purpose?\"  hanna smiled a bit, if sardonically.  \"peter here was a priest in his former life.  i guess that i can see how stopping the outsiders could be seen as a... divine purpose.\"  \"indeed.  the grace of our lady asherah be upon you, and all of us.  may i ask your name?\"  i shrugged a shoulder.  \"edin.\"  \"a strong name, edin.  no doubt fitting for a man strong enough to fight in the war of armageddon.\"  he closed his book to address us more directly.  i could appreciate that.  \"and yes, i do think that coming here is a divine purpose.  for what else could our summons be?\"  he turned his attention fully to me.  \"tell me, are you familiar with the good word?\"  i shook my head.  \"i should be surprised, however experience has taught me otherwise.  of all the souls goddess ashera has made, how many of them strong enough for this ultimate task, i have yet to encounter another with knowledge of her.  a pity, perhaps, but at the same time... perhaps it is fitting in the end.  do not fear, i will not force her wisdom upon you, but all created, knowing of her or not, are worthy of freedom from these demonic entities.  for that, you have my word, i will always be available to you should you need me, for tasks both on the field of battle and of the spirit.\"  hanna was rolling her eyes where peter couldn't see, but i rather liked this guy.  where he was from, his religion most likely was a part of every aspect of life.  yet he wasn't trying to force it on me.  i'd encountered far, far worse.  \"thanks.\"  peter reached out to pat my arm comfortingly.  \"a man of few words, but of great action.  all know of your efforts to save lady lia.  she is well loved by those here, both those tasked with the holy duty of resonation and otherwise.  words are hollow, but you've already bloodied yourself in battle for the sake of another.  fear not of my opinion of you, it will be shaped by your intent, not by how much you choose, or simply can, say.\"  he turned his attention to hanna.  \"please, continue introducing him to the others.  you do well to not overwhelm him, but there are those for whom socialization is a struggle.\"  she shook her head.  \"yeah, that's why i waited until after everyone else left.  thanks pete.\"  peter bowed his head.  \"go with the goddess, my friends.  amen.\"  \"amen,\" i muttered, already turning to hanna.  \"i'm not down on the whole religion thing,\" she said quietly as she led me away.  \"but pete?  he's better than most.  he's been blowing his req on the rest of us, gifts and stuff that he thinks will, you know, 'bring us peace' or whatever.  i'd rather deal with him than zack.  at least--\"  \"and no introduction for me?\" a melodic voice behind us asked, making hanna bristle.  great.  what was i getting into now?  i tend and found a shorter woman smiling coyly up at me.  her facial structure was near-human, and her hair was a maddening myriad of colors that you couldn't even reproduce with dye.  it was an interesting, even alluring combination.  and then suddenly i could see through it all.  her entire appearance, beyond her body shape and impressive bosom was an illusion, and a damn good one at that.  good enough that she could probably keep it up without thought or maintenance, even being up in her sleep.  but it didn't change the fact that underneath was a plain, downright mousy young woman.  a young woman who was looking up at me curiously now.  something about me had caught her attention.  thankfully, hanna was there, even if she wished that this young woman wasn't.  \"edin, this is evangela.  she self-identifies as a--\"  \"i **am** a changeling,\" evangela corrected, as my ability to see through the illusion faded.  interesting.  stil, her claim was bullshit.  i knew changelings, multitudes of different kinds of faerie creatures.  this was nothing more than a woman adept at keeping a visual facade of one.  \"evangela, this is edin,\" hanna grumbled.  \"i remember seeing you yesterday,\" she said demurely.  her hand raised to me, palm down, in an offering.  out of standard protocol reflex, i took it and pressed my lips to it, careful in my positioning to keep it from being seen as flirty.  unfortunately, that only seemed to encourage her.  \"there is something about your eyes...  tell me, do you have the blood of the fae in your veins?\"  an awkward silence hung in the air as i stared at her with half-lidded eyes.  after a moment, hanna snorted.  \"typical edin.  get used to this.  you're lucky to get anything out of him.  i think silence is his typical mode.\"  \"but not vacancy,\" evangela mused.  \"his eyes might be empty, but not vacant.\"  she stepped closer to me, ignoring hanna's death glare, to place a hand on my chest.  \"no, they absorb all, showing that a keen mind lurks within this quiet soul.  perchance, is it pain that stills your voice and mutes your body so?\"  \"no,\" i croaked.  \"who i am.\"  she giggled in a way that reminded me of an instrument as she pulled her hand back.  \"perhaps so.  but no man is set and stone, being shaped and changed by those whose company he keeps and the experiences of his life.\"  \"yes,\" hanna and i said in unison, making her crack up.  what was so funny about that?  evangela didn't seem to know any more than me by her expression.  \"anyway,\" hanna said as her laughter died down, \"ildefons is waiting for us.\"  \"sure.\"  hanna didn't seem to like evangela much.  moving on to the last person in the commons might be for the best.  well, the last two people.  sitting on a plush leather couch against a wall was a man and a woman.  the woman was local by the looks of her, having donw what she could to make her worker's jumpsuit more fitting to her body and lowering her zipper enough to put her modest cleavage on display as much as she could.  no doubt to make he more appealing to the man she was cooing up to.  the man, on the other hand, was dressed in a strange approximation of a dress suit that looked good on him.  his hair, though, didn't match his apparel; most of it was pulled into a ponytail, with one long and thin braid, interwoven with beads, running down the side of his face.  he looked like he owned the couch, but that was more confidence than anything.  he looked away from the woman and to us as hanna forced me to sit next to him, taking a nearby chair for herself.  \"ah,\" he said, a wide and lazy grin spreading across his face.  \"the hollow makes his rounds.\"  evangela sighed as she settled in another chair, apparently not content to leave us alone.  \"ildefons, don't be like that.\"  \"no offense intended,\" he said directly to me.  \"just an observation.\"  hanna scoffed.  \"yeah, don't take offense.  he can be blunt like that.  ildefons here was the leader of a tribe of nomads--\"  \"barbarians,\" he corrected quickly.  \"nomads gives the wrong impression.  we foraged for nothing, and our only prey were hard-working communities.  i will *not* sugar-coat my previous life, nor will i make excuses for it.  i was who i was.  \"and for the record, i was neither merely a leader, nor a mere king of my clan.  all the clans called me the god-king.\"  hanna rolled her eyes.  \"you know, i've always found it funny that the 'god-king' can be so comfortable with just being a resonator.\"  \"just?\"  now it was ildefons' turn to snort.  \"that says more of you than you think, my dear hanna.  \"but 'tis true, i am comfortable here.  though most resonators ignore it, there is great glory to be had in our task.  the fact that this place offers such maddening luxury in comparison to my previous life just makes it sweeter.\"  he turned his attention to the woman that his arm was around.  \"and the company is simply *delightful.*\"  by the way she blushed, i got the impression that the common person didn't interact with resonators very often.  or if they did, they weren't encountering such a smooth talking lothario as he was shaping up to be.  still, there were worse people in the universe.  i'd both killed them and been them.  still, i had my own questions.  \"quiet.\"  hanna was the only one who didn't look at me curiously.  she was probably used to me at this point.  \"since that thing with lia, the outsiders have been getting more active.  not locally, though.  at least, not yet.  we had a 'volunteer only' call to help with another redoubt.\"  amah slammed down a chair and sat in it backwards, folding her arms over the back of it.  apparently she wanted to join in the conversation.  \"i'm still down from that... accident.  which wouldn't have happened if people wouldn't have made a fuss about it in the first place.\"  evangela smiled faintly.  \"peter stayed because it's a religious holiday of some sort for him.\"  \"he'd still fight if the need was there,\" ildefons mused.  \"with everyone else volunteering to go, i can understand his wish to stay.  who am i to begrudge a man his peace on occasion?  \"meanwhile, i stayed because...\"  he trailed off, concentrating.  after a moment, he turned to his companion.  \"it isn't my slayer's bones that are wounded, but its superstructure is damaged?\"  the woman's eyes lit up.  \"that's right!  you were paying attention!\"  ildefons wasn't stupid, but he was still a primitive barbarian.  it was easier for him to understand it as bones.  superstructure was a meaningless word to him.  but he also understood seduction, paying attention, and showing it to others.  i could respect that more than negging.  \"why'd you stay?\" hanna asked evangela, doing a passable job of hiding her animosity.  evangela grinned, almost purring her response.  \"sounta blossoms.\"  hanna rolled her eyes.  a fair response.  evangela was doing her best fae impersonation, but it was an impersonation by someone who had read about them in a book, not someone who had ever interacted with them.  thankfully, ildefons was there to defuse the situation.  he looked from the unnamed woman to me.  \"this piece of advice is for the both of you.  peter cares little for the divide between resonators and staff.  he is also respectful of those who care little for his religion.  what he is, though, is a good listener, who refrains from the grandest of mistakes: he neither judges nor forces advice upon you.  he will only help you how you wish it, and will always try and help you to come to whatever realization you need yourself rather than impose his will on you.\"  he turned his attention to his arm candy.  \"and i mean it.  if you ever need a soul to talk to, seek him out.  i give you my oath on my clan, even at his worst, his council is worth it.\"  from his table, peter looked up from his writing.  \"thank you, ildefons.  that means a great deal, coming from you.\"  ildefons smiled.  \"no, thank you.\"  i got the impression that the two talked frequently.  the woman grinned, leaning against ildefons.  \"and what if i want to talk to you?\"  he laughed.  \"no matter how i talk or act, i'll always think like a barbarian.  my advice...  you'd probably find it interesting.  but i'll always gladly talk to you.  only outsiders could pull me away.\"  \"what about the rest of us?\" hanna asked.  \"edin might want your advice on us.\"  honestly, i didn't care.  but ildefons was already turning to me.  \"hanna is rough, but reliable both in combat and out.  she suffers a bit for being a student of the fellow known as senpai, but not in a bad way.  to each their own.  should she allow you into her inner circle, you'll find a brave and true friend.  \"amah is crafty and clever, moreso than one might give her credit for.  she will lead outsiders into a trap that will leave them reeling, and then follow up on it with brutal efficiency.  she would have done well in my clan.  indeed, i would have had her as one of my trusted lieutenants.  \"just beware her love for explosives.\"  \"hey,\" amah whined, but both hanna and evangela were laughing.  \"finally, evangela.  a mystery and enigma.  beyond that, however, she is a master of illusion magic.  there is a reason why she and amah fight so well together.\"  \"guilty as charged,\" evangela purred.  \"beyond that, she's an expert entertainer, gifted with both song and story.  in fact--\"  i blinked, and time flew by.  when i finally got my focus again, hanna was patting my arm as we stood outside my door.  i had the vague sense of the conversation continuing until we gave ildefons some peace to woo the woman...  he'd said her name at some point, i was sure of it, but i just... couldn't remember.  and then we'd gotten a meal in, and...  and...  \"don't hide in your room too much,\" hanna said.  \"i've got a lot more people to introduce you to, but i'm willing to do it on your own terms, okay?\"  \"yes.\"  she smiled at that.  \"talking again, huh?  good.  get some rest, alright?\"  she gave my arm another awkward pat before turning and walking away.  as i watched her go, i realized what had happened.  i'd lost focus again, letting my body go on autopilot.  it felt like i'd lost it for only a moment, but hours had passed.  i blinked a few times, trying to get my brain sorted out.  i was getting better.  every life i got a little bit better, but if i lost focus on the present, days could fly by.  at least my body was remembering to go through the motions.  i'd eaten, and followed her.  at least there was that.  still, i had a long way to recover.  i opened the door, only to find a pile of jumpsuits on my bed.  how the hell...  that officer.  he said he'd get me some clothes.  i may have lost focus, but at least something had gone right today.  now, did he get me underwear and socks, too?", "NSFW": "False", "title": "thousands: settling in: chapter 2"}, {"text": "i'm struggling. i'm drinking, i even bought cigarettes for the first time in 8 months and i have a very strong desire to do drugs, but thankfully they're not available. i have had zero motivation to meditate, to run, to eat well. i'm even struggling with the motivation to self destruct (via self harm, purposely getting fired, arguments with those close to me), as has been a consistent feeling throughout previous depressive bouts. this time i'm not engaging in physical self harm, but i am indulging the desire to drink and smoke, and a familiar feeling is back - that even though i know what i'm doing i don't care and actively seem to be encouraging it.    i feel like this could be seasonal affective disorder kicking in and re aggravating symptoms of depression i'd mitigated with meditation and better lifestyle choices. i can't get a dr's appointment for two weeks and even when we do meet, i feel that all my options are going to involve spending money i don't have (bright light) or taking medication (prozac over a 10 month period made my depression significantly worse in the past).    anyone any helpful ideas?

[the u.s. is urbanizing rapidly,]( http://media.navigatored.com/images/migration-chart.jpg), and eventually those living in rural areas will simply be completely drowned out politically by those in

closer to death than i realized at the time during this trip. that being said this was the most intense trip ive ever had, both visually and mentally. i was in the marine corps at the time. i had just gotten out of rehab and felt lost. after attending an aa meeting i met another fellow marine who happened to live in the barracks just across the way from me. i grabbed his number and the next day he called me he said he was thinking about drinking. i told him not to and headed over to his room.  i poured his liqour down the toilet and we played some madden to keep his mind off of things. after about find minutes, we looked at each other and said being sober sucks! i told him i wanted to get fucked up but we both decided drinking wasnt an option. i suggested that i knew a girl out in town that coild get us acid. he loved the idea, so we called her up and low and behold she said she had some. we went and grabbed the tabs from her and went back to the barracks. we unfolded the tin foil and looked at the tabs. the were a rainbow of colors. not from the paper itself, but instead from the chemical that was dripped onto them. we were both inexperienced so we didnt really know what to look for. we both said fuck it and we layed 2 tabs on each of our tounges. i instantly noticed a metallic tastes, and my tounge went very numb like i had just put cocaine in my mouth. if i had the knowledge that i have now i never would have tried them in the first place. we sat there and let the tabs dissolve. we put on the itunes visualizer and awaited our journey into the ether. right at the 20 minute mark i started to notice a intensely overwhelming nervousness and everything became very  bright. the last sober memory before my trip started is him turning to me and saying \"this is that face melting shit\" this is when things started getting very weird and intense.  as the drugs started to intensify, i looked at the room around me and things literally started to melt. not just acid melt, but lile literally melt. instead of the material melting into the floor the matter seemed to suspend itself into the air. we shut off the lights and stared at the tv. i started to notice tubes of fractals leaving the tv and enveloping me so intensely that i became very frightened. i jumped up and turned the lights on. we went outside to smoke and the trees and grass were vibrating and flaming with every neon color on and off the spectrum. i lite up my cigarette and looked at it. it started to dice itself into pieces. i dropped it and ran back into the room. the change of setting brought me back to reality for a split second before everything intensified by a million. the room was now fully alive with patterns of unknow hieroglyphics streamjng down all the walls. i couldnt take it. i jumped into the bed and covered myself with the blankets. this didnt help. the blanket seemed to be infinite. i kept pulling it and it just kept coming. i was now in full freakout mode. i jumoed back up with the room becoming less and less familiar. reality started to fade and my new existence seemed to be the only thing in existence. my friend was having a blast but i was getting hit way to hard. he started to mive towards me, but full loop mode kicked in. he kept repeating the same movments and words over and over and over again. i then looked at my hands and they started to dematerialize right before my eyes. i couldnt control it. i drifted aways into nothingness until i could no longer see my body. i was for sure that i had passed into the next world. i dont really recal exactly what happend next , but i do remeber experiencing many realities at once, not one of them pleasant. i was under the impression that i no longer existed. however this was not the case. my friend took a video of me, and in the video i was standing in the middle of the room speaking what seemed to be a mix of an alien language and gibberish. this seemed to last for hours. in an instance. i saw my self rematerialize and i could finally see my body and hands again. however i was still tripping extremely intensely. i was holding on for dear life. even though my peak was over i still had a good 8 hours of tripping left. i kept dematerializing but could force myself to stay at the very least in between realities. i walked over to the mirror and saw myself as a demon in technicolor. my hard was racing fast that i could practically seem my heart trying to leave my chest. as i started to settle into the trip everything became a giant lava lamp and everything had an intricacy of patterns and moving cogs inside of them, including my hands. the vibration of my body was still very intense. i rode the trip out until noon. we started at 7pm. it lasted so long, and it seemed like it lasted for days not hours. we watched the most insane infomercials for hours until the drugs completely worw off. as things came to an end, my friend looked at me and said \"dude that definitely wasnt acid\" i concurred. i didnt have much experience, but i knew that 2 tabs didnt bring you to level 5 of the tripping scale. we tested the other 2 tabs we didnt take. it turned out to be 25i. i researched it and was glad that i had lived through it! there is so much more to this, but as you know a trip cant fit into a small story or even and story really. it is an adventure that is unlanguagable. if you made it this far thankyou for reading. this was over 7 years ago and i now always test my drugs. this is the first time sharing. i hope you all enjoyed my trip report, and i cant

 &#x200b;  so i go to this medical academy high school. my classmates are mostly aspiring physicians. i came into the academy, however, with different goals - i wanted to be a dentist. after losing my front two teeth in a middle school mishap, i've been super involved with the dentist's office. i would be in-and-out of the dentist's at least twice a week. i grew to love dentistry so much that i studied for dental terminology competitions, placed internationally, and even joined the national institute of dental and craniofacial research as an intern. i knew that, if i were to enter a field, it would definitely be dentistry.   &#x200b;  however, i soon realized that dentistry isn't what i hoped it would be. i never wanted to admit it, but dentistry was more about the lifestyle and money than it is about helping the community. i volunteered a lot in low-income areas in high school, and i saw that people needed healthcare **desperately**. like some people i knew who lived in these places would literally not go to the doctor cuz they couldn't afford to pay for it. i then found an internship in an urgent care practice.    i had to literally turn people down if they didn't have insurance. a lady was gushing blood from her lips right in front of my face... but i told her we don't accept her insurance.... and i sent her out the door. i was devastated. my dad convinced me that, maybe dentistry was just a phase... and i should go into medicine if that's what i found more value in.   &#x200b;  i was at a huge crossroads. my classmates were spamming applications to 17+ bs/md programs (i'm not even joking)... and here i was, this confused ass kid who had no idea what he wanted to do anymore. i wrote essays about why i wanted to go into medicine, applied to a few bs/mds, and here i am today.  &#x200b;  but now, i feel like i'm making decisions that i haven't had enough time to think about. i don't want to go into a career for the money, and i know more \"value\" lies in medicine.... but how do i know which career is right for me? like i feel like i can't make this decision right now... but what if i don't get into med school after 4 years? what if i find out dentistry is what i like, and i get into some bs/md? what if i go in pre-med, but find out dentistry is my career goal, and i can't get in cuz my resume wasn't up to par?  &#x200b;  i just don't know anymore. what do you guys think i should do? did i make the right choice by ditching my passion for dentistry to choose medicine simply because i thought medicine was more \"valuable\" to the community? am i even correct in thinking this? should i have applied to more bs/mds? should i have applied to bs/dmds??? i have no fucking clue bruh. i'm just ranting at this point, but i'm just so

 # tier 1  tyreek hill- who doesn't want hill right now? young explosive wr tied to one of if not the best looking qbs in the league. hill has had a huge increase in his role and volume on the chiefs and its likely this is going to carry on into next year. mahomes and hill are just a perfect match for each other's skill set, and even if mahomes regresses next year, tyreek is still the kind of player who can make plays on his own. so even if we see mahomes regress slightly, hill will always be one play away from scoring a 50 yard touch down. hill might have reached that premium price already, so he may be impossible to trade for now, but i would throw some offers out if possible.  &#x200b;  chubb + duke- well chubb is off to a great start and it's reasonable to think that the browns offense is only going to get better from here. baker looks legit and should be even better next year. it's clear the browns really like pounding the ball with one back, and chubb looks to be the guy. i do still really like duke here, because he is such a great player. if chubb ever goes down, duke becomes an instant high rb2/low rb1, and even with chubb there, he could (and should) see his role expand. he's shown what he can do, and it's too bad the browns don't use him more often. if riddick can somehow catch 5 balls a game with kerryon and blount there, duke should be able to too.  &#x200b;  kerryon johnson- loved this guy in the draft. going to be a tough guy to grab now because he looks fantastic. he has shown that he can handle the lion's share of carries in college, but he does get banged up. hopefully the lions will give him plenty of touches next year, but will have a few cop guys for short yardage and relief duties. kerryon is just so versatile that it's a shame he isn't being used better. he's a guy who has looked to great with the ball in his hands that even with a minimal amount of carries he gets it done. he reminds me of kamara in that sense, and i really hope the lions take a page out of the saint's rb book and use it themselves.   &#x200b;  corey davis- this guy has been a nightmare this season but has shown what he is capable of. he's a huge part of the offense and realistically you have to assume the titan's offense can only go up. when mariota is in, cd is usually his go to guy, though we have seen random games where someone else on the team gets 10 targets (looking at you tajae sharpe). i think cd is still a blue chip asset that just hasn't had a real chance to prove it yet. some people might be looking to sell him to get off the roller coaster, and i think he's worth a buy.  &#x200b;  &#x200b;  # tier 2  jerick mckinnon- honestly wasn't a big fan of him this year, but seeing how the sf offense is using their rbs, i am very interested in mckinnon for next year. i don't think he is a special talent, but he is a guy who i expect to get plenty of touches, and more importantly, plenty of catches. if we see a tandem of breida and mckinnon, mckinnon is definitely the guy i want. breida has looked great this year, and sf is using him really creatively which i love, because i think he's a great player. i think sf will use mckinnon in a ton of different ways too, and i could see him being a set-and-forget rb2/flex guy who catches 4+ balls a game and gets a few rushes as well.  &#x200b;  gio bernard- cinci has given so much disrespect to gio. i think gio is a really great player who is criminally underutilized. i also love mixon, so it's too bad that gio kind of got swept to the side. despite being under contract through next year, i could see the bengals letting him go and him getting a bigger role somewhere else, like a dion lewis. in gio's first three years in the league, he had 1.2k, 1k, and 1.2k yards from scrimmage, respectively. he's a great pass catcher, which gives him a good floor, and a good enough rusher, that i think he could be great in a 1a/1b situation (similar to mckinnon). gio is only 27, and as a pass catcher could still have a number of years left in his career.  &#x200b;  christian kirk- i don't get why this sub was so low on him before the draft--and he even went 2.03 in my dynasty draft. kirk has done nothing but increase his stock this season, and has a great connection with rosen. the cardinals can really only go up from here, and with fitz likely retiring this year or next, kirk is the heir apparent to all the slot duties. he is fast and will surely step into a high volume role as one of the trusted pass catchers on the team. he's definitely a risk if the cardinals don't get it together next year, but he is a great guy to invest in for the long term.  &#x200b;  dede westbrook- dede might be the only jags wr of note. dede does work every game and is really proving himself to be a great wr. a beletnikoff winner in college, he has done nothing but prove that he is a great wr on a terrible offense. it would not surprise me if bortles is gone next year and we see a (hopefully) more capable qb step in. a more reliable passer could only do great things for dede. he's not on pace for a great season, but if there is any light in the passing options on the jags, i think it's dede, who might be good for a buy low.  &#x200b;  # tier 3  antonio callaway- callaway was getting 10+ passes thrown his way from baker at the start of the season. obviously, he's got some troubles with drops, so baker has moved away from him. we can hopefully just attribute this to being a rookie and hope that he gets it together, which he should. i love callaway as another huge play threat on that offense that baker seems to like quite a bit. we've seen him with better hands the last few games, and we know baker isn't afraid to let it fly down the field. if callaway and baker work on that connection for next year, i think callaway is a great buy, especially at a low price right now.  &#x200b;  trey quinn- mr. irrelevant, how! 1.2k yards and 13 tds in his last season with smu before declaring for the draft. know who else was on that team? courtland sutton, who has 1k yards and 12 tds the same year. quinn is a slot guy and caught over 100 balls that last season at smu, and has now stepped into a slot roll for the redskins. crowder really has not looked great this year, and i would not be at all surprised if quinn comes in and takes the role away. quinn is a bulky dude who can body guys in the slot. he's not exceptionally fast (4.55 time) or athletic, but he might just be what the redskins need--a reliable pass option.   &#x200b;  deon cain- did you know deon cain was the 4th highest ranked prospect by [nfl.com](https://nfl.com) after ridley, sutton, and moore? cain did not produce how people were hoping at clemson, but on an andrew luck powered offense, he is as intriguing as it gets. he doesn't have to be the #1 option there, that probably belongs to ty or even the te pair, but he was getting good reports out of camp before tearing his acl. he's going to come back and hopefully step into the wr2 role on the team (i am admittedly low on everyone but ty there) so he is a great guy to add that is probably sitting on your waiver right now.", "NSFW": "False", "title": "all the players i'm looking at for 2019"}, {"text": "white, 5'10\", fat, bearded, long hair  looking for a woman to just take it away.  doesn't matter if you're experienced or not, just looking to get it over with", "NSFW": "True", "title": "23 [m4f] #murfreesboro tn - virgin looking to lose it"}, {"text": "tenanta translates to keeping  - fill in missing translations: https://www.reddit.com/r/word of the hour/comments/95v7rk/we need your help help us improve our translations/", "NSFW": "False", "title": "word of the hour: tenanta"}, {"text": "tenant translates to keeping  - report an incorrect translation: https://www.reddit.com/r/word of the hour/comments/95v7rk/we need your help help us improve our translations/", "NSFW": "False", "title": "word of the hour: tenant"}, {"text": "i've googled this issue extensively on reddit and steamcommunity forums and i've seen alot of varying degrees of this issue reported.  raining inside all owned starships or specific ships raining sounds near all owned starships or specific ships  some users reporting this issue extends to exocrafts as well.  running on a ps4 pro 1.75  looking for solutions as this bug seems to have already been reported multiple patches ago.", "NSFW": "False", "title": "raining inside my starships on all planets"}, {"text": "if you dont have a mic please be experienced  &#x200b;", "NSFW": "False", "title": "i need help with pacific standard and selling weed on ps4"}, {"text": "where did you get started roasting and how did you meet the heath department's requirements? do they require a grey water connection?", "NSFW": "False", "title": "your first place for commercial roasting?"}, {"text": "finally going to my first game in stubhub on the 9th! on the lower sideline tickets it says obstructed view, is that because the players on the side are blocking the view? i am gonna buy chargers sideline tickets but what section/ how far up do you guys recommend? thanks for the help!", "NSFW": "False", "title": "lower sideline tickets/ seating question"}, {"text": "zachary dash appointed as new cmo of [verma media](https://www.aihitdata.com/company/01e8b3ed/verma-media/overview)", "NSFW": "False", "title": "verma media: cmo change"}, {"text": "hey all!  how would i check to extract a number n from a string? some examples being \"36years\" \"1month\" \"2days\" etc. i would want the actual value 36 not but \"3\" and \"6\".  &#x200b;

time we were in 7th grade until i was 23. basically this means i'm free to explore for the first time ever. it was scary at first, but i leaned into it a little bit. i started experimenting with anal, women, with older men, with some college freshmen, co-workers, etc. i settled into a few frequent fuck buddies as a way of keeping myself sane, but haven't been too adventurous as of late.   i recently moved into a new apartment. it's in a nice enough building and i'm a physician's assistant so i do okay. my neighbors are all pretty much young professionals. i was convinced that the couple who live above me hate each other. they screamed constantly and just seemed aggressive with each other from what i could overhear, and it was hard to avoid.  one day i was out walking my dog, strudel, and i noticed this guy walking behind me on his way into the building. he had been running or working out, but he was really hot. tall and built, nice hair, and his cock was just slightly visible through his gym shorts. we started talking and i found out his name is carl and he worked in insurance. to be honest that's all i really fucking cared about because i was batting my eyes and touching his arm within seconds of meeting him. he said he needed to go back inside and i just went for it. \"come in with me. maybe we can find you a shirt.\"   well, we didn't find him a shirt, but i found him inside me for the better part of two hours on basically every surface in my apartment. his dick is big and thick and i just absolutely cannot get enough of it or him. i see him probably three or four times a week, even if it's just to be quick.   fast forward to a couple days later. i met this cute girl at the bar in the retail space on the first floor of our building. i was having a glass of wine and i definitely started picking up signals. i'm still relatively new to being with women, so the flirty introductions are always very thrilling. her name was cadence but she told me to call her cade. she was about 5'7\" and sort of thick with big round boobs and a big butt to match. i'm something of a melon felon when it comes to my ladies, tbh. either way, we ended up kissing in the bar and then making arrangements to come back in a few days. we met back up and we only managed to finish one drink before we were upstairs on my bed. she does this thing where she grabs my hair and pulls me closer into her pussy as i'm going down on her that just drives me crazy. we fuck maybe four or five times a month and it's easily the best sex i've ever had with a woman.   whelp, it turns out that cade and carl are married. i was a little shocked at first, but then i was really, really turned on. last week while i was fucking cade, i was extra loud. carl sent me a text and he could hear me from their apartment. \"whoa, sounds like someone is having a little too much fun.\" so i asked cade if she could hear me fucking other people and she said absolutely.   in short, i'm really fucking turned on by being the other person in this terrible marriage to both the husband and wife and making them listen and i get fucked stupid by their s/os.   i'm terrible, apparently, but i'm fully satisfied.",

 &#x200b;  during the meeting the financial advisor convinced my father to have his money actively managed for a fee of 0.75%. i was talking with my father today about this fee, and he doesn't remember having agreed to it. i understand how he missed this. the advisor sort of threw that detail in while my father was signing on for the annuity. this was, i think, intentional.  &#x200b;  since meeting with the fidelity financial advisor, i have been building a picture of my father's finances. my father has sufficient income from social security and his deceased wife's pension. the money in the traditional ira with fidelity is sort of extra at the moment. he could get by without it. the reason the fidelity financial advisor gave for my father buying the annuity was that he was dependent on the traditional ira for income. the fidelity advisor did not ask (and my father said has never asked) about income sources like social security and the pension.   &#x200b;  is this about what i should expect from a financial advisor? if not, how do i go about finding a better financial advisor?  &#x200b;  if my father wanted to cease having his money actively managed (and pay the fee), how would he communicate this? and is this a pretty simple request?

i had a clean mri (but my main complaint about the mri is that they manually depressed my shoulder to the table during it) and clean x-ray. one doctor thought tennis shoulder, another thought frozen shoulder with no diagnosis on the  initial injury, another thought ligament or tendon damage. a fourth put me into physical therapy and steroid treatment without looking at the shoulder at all. i went to half of the 6-8 week treatment until the ligament/tendon diagnosis and refused further treatment until i saw an orthopedic doctor.  i guess i'm looking to see if anyone has any better ideas as to what this may be. it's to the point that it's a struggle to put on a jacket, it's becoming bilateral, and i've increased my drinking to deal with the pain and honestly frustration about the entire situation.   thanks in advanced!", "NSFW": "False", "title": "shoulder injury"}, {"text": "hey both my controllers often unsync from my xbox when consoles off. everything's updated and the controllers are never more than 7 feet away from console. big problem is when i try re-syncing them they won't sync and will just keep blinking. sometimes resetting the xbox fixes it but sometimes not, and then i'll be left screwing with it for 20 mins. any ideas? batteries are brand new and i'm the only one using xbox so settings don't get touched. makes me not even want to use the xbox", "NSFW": "False", "title": "controller issues"}, {"text": "give me a joi as a celeb of your choice?  kik darkdesiresofmine", "NSFW": "True", "title": "give me joi!"}, {"text": "ben moralee appointed as new cfo of [elecosoft](https://www.aihitdata.com/company/01dafd9a/elecosoft/overview)", "NSFW": "False", "title": "elecosoft: cfo change"}, {"text": "hi /r/costco,   i need advice/help getting a specific type of tires from costco's tire center. the only issue is that every time i check all the costco centers in my area (i live in seattle, wa) they are always sold out of the specific tires i want (bridgestone - potenza re980as;

  i didn't really think much of it, so i told her i was going home to do homework. then she asks me questions about myself, like what classes i'm taking, and she mentions the fact that i play soccer, even though it's been a while since i mentioned that. she tells me that i should write more music, but i tell her i mostly make video-game music. we talk for maybe 5 minutes, but the conversation ends when i don't really have anything else to say and she goes to talk to someone else.  i'm awkward around girls.     all this time i just assumed she had a boyfriend, which is why i didn't really think much of it nor make any moves on her. but then i went to her facebook yesterday and it said she was single.  if she really is single, then she didn't break up with her boyfriend not too long ago because just 3 weeks ago, she was still dating him.      so is it possible that she was hitting on me and expressing interest in dating me or was she just being friendly with me?  she's a naturally friendly person, so that could be the case.   i'm afraid that if i make a move and it turns out she does have a boyfriend or isn't interested, it burns the bridge between us and it would be awkward to still to her.  but at the same time, i'm afraid if i don't make a move, she will likely lose interest if she hasn't already from the last conversation we had.      also, she just broke up with her boyfriend not too long ago so i don't know if i should wait a month or two before making a move.      what do you think i should do?

even.  looking at s&p+ scores between 4 of them (msu, uf, lsu, mizzou) there's 1.1 point.  that's a 52 wins out of 100 games.  i'd call that within the margin of error.   when you get to the cfp

however, i feel like doing a different limited pov per chapter is the more standard practice, but frankly that just doesn't work for my story at all. it really needs to change povs each time there's a scene, not chapter, change.   i'm a very chapter-oriented writer and plan and outline everything on the chapter level with the general goal being to present thematically consistent scenes with a chapter, or to intentionally juxtapose and contrast different scenes. my chapters often, but not always, are also designed to tell a mini-story of their own or to address a particular plot point or event. i say this because while i don't care at all about chapter length, it really wouldn't work to just break chapters with each scene/pov shift because i want the various scenes in a given chapter grouped all together in a single chapter with a thematic or plot throughline, not as like five or six smaller scene-based chapters.  so anyway, what are your opinions about pov changes with each scene change?   as a caveat, a recurring structure i've been using is to essentially have my main characters grouped together in pairs, threes, or fours (there are six protagonists and three antagonists) and on a chapter-by-chapter basis they're often on a, b, and c storylines -- i kinda hate to call it a, b, and c though because i'm careful to make sure that each scene and storyline is important, and i'm not just hopping back and forth between a pair of characters trying to dismantle a bomb and another pair having coffee or something. i know that would obviously be frustrating to readers and would make them not care about the obviously less important storyline. each storyline within a chapter is carrying its weight, and if one is clearly more important then i give it the focus and keep any deviation to other chapter storylines brief and relevant. *but* i do quite like using the multiple scene breaks within a single storyline as an opportunity to switch into the other storyline character's pov as the stakes shift for the characters.   so for example in a given chapter bob and dave might be tracking the villain, let's say bob's ex-lover into a warehouse to rescue dave's sister. the chapter might start with bob and dave confronting bob's ex-lover/the villain, and thus obviously bob is the pov character because he's the one with more at stake emotionally in the confrontation. the there might be a scene break and a switch to mary and angela in a completely different location (but generally the same moment in story time) breaking out of prison. then it's back to bob and dave, but now dave is the pov character because he's about to be reunited with his sister, so he's the one with the higher stakes.  so...yeah, general thoughts and opinions about multiple pov shifts within a chapter at the end of scenes?", "NSFW": "False", "title": "multi povs per chapter, but one per scene"}, {"text": "since it launched yesterday i had to do a hard reset on my xbox just to get it to update, now the only buttons that are working for me are rt and lt which make it zoom in and out like you're viewing the map. literally unplayable, i'm assuming this is due to the online beta being released", "NSFW": "False", "title": "online is f'ing up my story mode"}, {"text": "lol.   sigh.", "NSFW": "False", "title": "twine ssd 10 completed and reward was a level 1 chest?"}, {"text": "i think i just came to the realization that i never was truly in love with my first girlfriend. we were together just shy of 3 years. i was not hurt when it was over. i've gone through a few heartbreaks since then, and they were far more hurtful.   i think i was more in love with being her support system (she had severe depression, anxiety, ptsd, self harm issues and was occasionally suicidal)  but now that i look back, i don't think i really loved her.  i loved being there for her, and being the only one who could get into her brain and calm her down. it was sort of a sigh of relief when it ended. but now, i seem to attract and be attracted to these \"broken\" girls. i myself have very mild depression, but nothing else. i know they say you can't fix somebody. but i'm in love with the idea of trying.  so anyways, i'm sorry, a. but i wouldn't have wanted to go through all of that with anyone else", "NSFW": "False", "title": "i never loved my girlfriend of 3 years"}, {"text": "the new killer is multiple people a cult/gang but the people are only different skins no aspect of the killer involves multiple killers on the map or a gang  what about a killer that is multiple people it would be awesome imagine a killer the takes 4 people to play where 4 people have the power equal to one killer but split between 4 different players it would also let swf play killer too instead of feeling the need to always be survivor since they are playing with friends  it would horribly difficult to balance because a 4 person killer would have too much map presence but its an idea  &#x200b;

'oh, maybe that message then wasn't from us after all. we need 24 hour to check'. by this stage, whoever sent me that link, they logged into my icloud and deactivated the 'find my iphone' block and the phone was removed from my account. furthermore, they therefore had access to everything on my icloud, which included all my photos, videos, over 400 contact numbers, addresses of all friends and family, everything you could imagine. apple's response 24 hours later? 'sorry. we gave you bad advice, our mistake. it was a scam after all'. that was a year ago, and i am still seething. their team have been rude and obnoxious on the phone when looking to be compensated for this. a third party gained access to all information on my icloud due to apple's mistake. apple's response to all of this?
